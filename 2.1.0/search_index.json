is a utility library that facilitates feature-based\ndevelopment in your react project.  It provides\ntangible assistance in promoting individual plug-and-play features\nwithin your project.\nMost developers would agree that organizing your project by feature is\nmuch preferred over type-based patterns.  Because application\ndomains grow in the real world, project organization by type\nsimply doesn't scale, it just becomes unmanageable!\nThere are a number of good articles that discuss this topic with\ninsight on feature-based design and structure.  However when it comes\nto the implementation, you are pretty much left to fend for yourself.\nfeature-u is a utility library that manages and streamlines this\nprocess.

Even when I\nstarted my career (back in the 70's), this was a prominent\nquote:\n\n\"All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection.\" David Wheeler\n\n\nBy breaking up your application into features, each feature can focus\non a more specific and isolated set of tasks.  In some ways you can\nthink of a feature as a \"mini application\"!\nThere are many design considerations in defining your feature\nboundaries.  You can find several articles on this topic that provide\ninsight on feature-based design.\nFor the most part, these considerations are part of the design of each\nindividual project.  While feature-u does not dictate overall\ndesign considerations, it does however facilitate good feature-based\nprinciples (such as encapsulation).  This will be the focus of this\nsection.\nSegregating Features\nIf you are like me, when you think about feature-based development, the first\nthing that comes to mind is to isolate your code into feature directories.\n\n\nIn doing this your code is organized by what it accomplishes (i.e. features),\nrather than what it is (i.e. components, routes, logic, actions, reducers,\nselectors, etc.).\nBy segregating your features into individual directories, there is\na semblance of isolation.\nFeature Goals\nOur goal is to encapsulate each feature in such a way as to make\nthem truly plug-and-play.  But how is this accomplished?\nThe directory structure is just a start.  There are several\nhurdles that must be overcome to realize our goal ...\n\nHow do we encapsulate and isolate our features, while still\nallowing them to collaborate with one another?\n\nHow can selected features introduce start-up initialization (even\ninjecting utility at the root DOM), without relying on some external\nstartup process?\n\nHow can feature-based UI Composition be accomplished in an\nisolated and autonomous way?\n\nHow do we configure our chosen frameworks now that our code is so\nspread out?\n\nHow do we enable/disable selected features which are either\noptional, or require a license upgrade?\n\n\nIn short, how do we achieve a running application from these\nisolated features?\nWhen you boil it all down, there are two overriding\ncharacteristics that must be accomplished to achieve our goals:\n\nFeature Runtime Consolidation: pulling our features back together into one running application\n\nFeature Collaboration: provide a mechanism by which our features can interact with one another\n\n\nAs it turns out, everything else is a byproduct of these two\nartifacts. Let's take a closer look at each of these items.\nFeature Runtime Consolidation\nNow that we have isolated our features into separate entities, how do\nwe bring them back together so they run as one application?\nWe must be able to pull and configure various aspects of our\nindividual features, and \"launch\" them as a single homogeneous running\napplication.\n\n\nThis concern can be further divided into two sub-concerns:\n\nApp Initialization\nSome features may require certain startup initialization.  As an\nexample, a feature that encapsulates some DB abstraction will rely\non a run-time setup of a DB service.\nCertainly we don't want to rely on some global app logic to\naccomplish this (once again, we want our features to be\nencapsulated and self-sufficient).\n \n\nFramework Configuration\nIf your application relies on other frameworks, chances are there are\nresources contained within each feature that must be accumulated and\nfed into the framework configuration process.\nHow is this accomplished?\n \n\n\nFeature Collaboration\nThe second characteristic (mentioned above) is Feature\nCollaboration - providing a mechanism by which our features can\ninteract with one another.\n \nA best practice of feature-based development (to the extent\npossible) is to treat each feature as an isolated implementation.\nMost aspects of a feature are internal to that feature's\nimplementation (for example, actions are typically created and\nconsumed exclusively by logic/reducers/components that are internal to\nthat feature).\nFrom this perspective, you can think of each feature as it's own\nisolated mini application.\nWith that said however, we know that \"no man is an island\"!  Any\ngiven feature ultimately exists as part of a larger application.\nThere are cases where a feature needs to promote a limited subset of\nit's aspects to other features.  For example, a feature may need to:\n\nbe knowledgeable of some external state (via a selector)\nemit or monitor actions of other features\nconsolidate component resources from other features - as in UI Composition\ninvoke the API of other features\netc. etc. etc.\n\nThese items form the basis of why\nCross Feature Communication and\nFeature Based UI Composition are needed.\n\n\nTo complicate matters, as a general rule, JS imports should NOT\ncross feature boundaries.  The reason being that this\ncross-communication should be limited to public access points -\nhelping to facilitate true plug-and-play.\n\n\nGiven all this then, how is Cross Feature Communication achieved\nin a way that doesn't break encapsulation?\nFeatures need a way to promote their Public Interface to other\nfeatures, and consume other feature's Public Assets.\nThe feature-u Solution\nLet's take a look at the solution feature-u provides for all of\nthese goals.  The following sections will build feature-u concepts\nincrementally.\nlaunchApp()\nlaunchApp() is an essential utility in feature-u.  It is an\nagent, working on your behalf, which provides the foundation that\naccomplishes all the goals of feature-u!  It facilitates both\nFeature Runtime Consolidation and Feature Collaboration.\nWith this utility, your mainline startup process is extremely\nsimple ... it merely invokes launchApp(), and you are done!\n\n\nThe launchApp() function actually starts your application running,\nemploying various hooks that drive BOTH App Initialization and\nFramework Configuration!\nYou can find launchApp() examples in the\nUsage section, and\nLaunching Your Application.\nHow does this work?  What are the bindings to launchApp()?\n... let's delve a bit deeper\nFeature Object\nTo accomplish this, each feature promotes a Feature object (using\ncreateFeature()), that catalogs aspects of interest to\nfeature-u.\nThis is the primary input to launchApp().\n\n\n\naspects\nIn feature-u, \"aspect\" (little \"a\") is a generalized term used\nto refer to the various ingredients that (when combined) constitute\nyour application.  Aspects can take on many different forms: UI\nComponents • Routes • State Management (actions,\nreducers, selectors) • Business Logic • Startup\nInitialization Code • etc. etc. etc.\nNot all aspects are of interest to feature-u ...  only those that\nare needed to setup and launch the application ... all others are\nconsidered an internal implementation detail of the feature.  As an\nexample, consider the redux state manager: while it uses actions,\nreducers, and selectors ... only reducers are needed to setup and\nconfigure redux.\n\n\nThe Feature object is merely a lightweight container that\nholds aspects of interest to feature-u.  These aspects can either\nbe Built-In aspects (from core feature-u),\nor Extendable aspects (from plugin extensions).\nRunning the App\nLet's see how launchApp() accommodates the two sub-goals of running the app:\n\nApp Initialization\nFramework Configuration\n\nApp Initialization\nBecause launchApp() is in control of starting the app, it\nhas a unique opportunity to introduce Application Life Cycle Hooks.\nThis allows each feature to perform app-specific initialization, and\neven inject static content in the root of your DOM.\nThere are three hooks:\n\nFeature.appWillStart() - invoked early in app startup (supports accumulative static root DOM injection)\nFeature.appInit()      - invoked later in app startup (supports blocking async initialization)\nFeature.appDidStart()  - invoked when app startup completes (triggers \"app is running\" processes)\n\n\n\nApplication Life Cycle Hooks greatly simplify your app's mainline\nstartup process, because initialization specific to a given feature\ncan be encapsulated in that feature.\nFramework Configuration\nA fundamental goal of feature-u is to automatically configure\nthe framework(s) used in your run-time-stack (by accumulating the\nnecessary resources across all your features).  This greatly reduces\nthe boilerplate code within your app.\nHow can this be accomplished when there are so many frameworks out\nthere ... and every project uses a different mix?\nfeature-u is extendable!  It operates in an open plugable\narchitecture where Extendable Aspects integrate feature-u to other\nframeworks, matching your specific run-time stack.  This is good,\nbecause not everyone uses the same frameworks!\nExtendable Aspects can be found in external NPM packages (the normal case), or you\ncan create your own using createAspect() (a more advanced topic).\n\n\nThe Aspect object contains a series of Aspect Life Cycle Hooks that are\ninvoked under the control of feature-u (launchApp()).\nIn general, an Aspect's responsibility is to:\n\naccumulate AspectContent across all features\nperform some desired setup and configuration\nexpose it's functionality in some way (typically a framework integration)\n\nAn Aspect automatically extends the Feature object by allowing\nit's AspectContent to be \"cataloged\" in the Feature using\nAspect.name as it's key.  In the diagram above, you can see that\n\nthe reducerAspect (Aspect.name: 'reducer') permits a\nFeature.reducer: reducerContent construct\n\nand the logicAspect (Aspect.name: 'logic') permits a\nFeature.logic: logicContent construct\n\n\nIt is important to understand that the interface to your chosen\nframeworks is not altered in any way.  You use them the same way you\nalways have (just within your feature boundary).  feature-u\nmerely provides a well defined organizational layer, where the\nframeworks are automatically setup and configured by accumulating the\nnecessary resources across all your features.\nLaunching Your Application\nIn feature-u the application mainline is very simple and generic.\nThere is no real app-specific code in it ... not even any global\ninitialization!  That is because each feature can inject their own\napp-specific constructs!!  The mainline merely accumulates the\nAspects and Features, and starts the app by\ninvoking launchApp():\nsrc/app.js\nimport ReactDOM              from 'react-dom';\nimport {launchApp}           from 'feature-u';\nimport {createRouteAspect}   from 'feature-router';\nimport {createReducerAspect} from 'feature-redux';\nimport {createLogicAspect}   from 'feature-redux-logic';\nimport features              from './features';\n\n// launch our app, exposing the Fassets object (facilitating cross-feature communication)\nexport default launchApp({           // *4*\n\n  aspects: [                         // *1*\n    createRouteAspect(),   // Feature Routes ... extending: Feature.route\n    createReducerAspect(), // redux          ... extending: Feature.reducer\n    createLogicAspect(),   // redux-logic    ... extending: Feature.logic\n  ],\n\n  features,                          // *2*\n\n  registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm) {   // *3*\n    ReactDOM.render(rootAppElm,\n                    getElementById('myAppRoot'));\n  }\n});\n\nHere are some important points of interest (match the numbers to\n*n* in the code above):\n\nthe supplied Aspects (pulled from separate npm\npackages) reflect the frameworks of our run-time stack (in our\nexample redux, redux-logic, and\nfeature-router) and extend the acceptable Feature\nproperties (Feature.reducer, Feature.logic, and\nFeature.route respectively) ... see:\nExtendable aspects\n\nall of our app features are supplied (accumulated from the\nfeatures/ directory)\n\na registerRootAppElm() callback is used to catalog the\nsupplied rootAppElm to the specific React platform in use.\nBecause this registration is accomplished by your app-specific\ncode, feature-u can operate in any of the React platforms, such\nas: react-web, react-native, and\nexpo ... see:\nReact Registration\n\nas a bit of a preview, the return value of launchApp()\nis a Fassets object, which promotes the accumulated\nPublic Face of all features, and is exported to provide\nCross Feature Communication.\n\n\nCross Feature Communication\nIn support of Feature Collaboration that doesn't break\nencapsulation, feature-u promotes feature-based resources through\nsomething called fassets (feature assets).  This is how all Cross\nFeature Communication is accomplished.  You can think of this as the\nPublic Face of a feature.\nSideBar: The term fassets is a play on words.  While it is\npronounced \"facet\" and is loosely related to this term, it is spelled\nfassets (i.e. feature assets).\nA feature can expose whatever it deems necessary through the built-in\nFeature.fassets aspect).  There is no real constraint on this\nresource.  It is truly open.\n\n\nThe fassets aspect has a define directive where\nresources are cataloged.\nHere is a simple example of how fassets are defined:\nexport default createFeature({\n\n  name:     'featureA',\n\n  fassets: {\n    define: {\n     'openView':      actions.view.open,      // openView(viewName): Action\n     'currentView':   selector.currentView,   // currentView(appState): viewName\n     'isDeviceReady': selector.isDeviceReady, // isDeviceReady(appState): boolean\n    },\n  },\n\n  ...\n});\n\nfeature-u accumulates fassets from all active features, and\npromotes them through the Fassets object (emitted from\nlaunchApp()).\nSideBar: There are several ways to obtain access the Fassets\nobject (see Obtaining fassets object).\nTo reference a fassets resource, simply dereference it as any other\nobject reference.  There is also a Fassets.get() method\nthat can be supplied Wildcards, returning an\narray of resources.\nif (fassets.isDeviceReady(appState)) {\n  ...\n}\n\nThis is an example of a push philosophy.  Here the supplier is is\nsimply publicly promoting a resource for other features to use (take\nit or leave it).  The supplier is merely saying: \"this is my Public\nFace\".\nYou can find more information about this topic in Cross Feature Communication.\nFeature Based UI Composition\nIt is common for a UI component to be an accumulation of\nsub-components that span several features.  As a result, UI\nComposition is a very important part of Cross Feature Communication.\nIn support of this, feature-u provides two APIs that give your\nUI components access to fassets.\n\nuseFassets() is a React Hook that provides\nfunctional component access to fassets.\nHooks are an exciting new React feature that allows you to\n\"hook into\" React state and lifecycle aspects from functional\ncomponents.\nHere is how a component would access a company.logo (defined\nby another feature):\nexport default function MyComponent() {\n\n  const Logo = useFassets('company.logo');\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n    ... snip snip\n  );\n}\n\nIn this example, because the Logo property is a component,\nMyComponent can simply reference it using JSX.\n\nwithFassets() is a Higher-order Component (HoC) that\nauto-wires fasset properties into a component.  This is a common\npattern popularized by redux connect() (simplifying component\naccess to application state).\nHere is the same example (from above) using withFassets():\nfunction MyComponent({Logo}) {\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n    ... snip snip\n  );\n}\n\nexport default withFassets({\n  component: MyComponent,\n  mapFassetsToProps: {\n    Logo: 'company.logo',\n  }\n});\n\nThe withFassets() HoC auto-wires named feature assets as\ncomponent properties through the mapFassetsToPropsStruct\nhook.\n\n\nYou can find more information about this topic in\nUI Composition.\nResource Contracts\nIt is common for UI Composition to be represented as a contract, where\na component in one feature has a series of injection needs that are to\nbe supplied by other features.\nThe fassets aspect has additional constructs to facilitate\nthis contractual arrangement, allowing feature-u to provide more\nvalidation in the process.\nRather than just defining resources in one feature and using them in\nanother:\n\nA given feature can specify a series of injection needs using the\nfassets.use directive.  This identifies a set of injection keys\nthat uniquely identify these resources.\n\nOther features will supply this content using the fassets.defineUse\ndirective, by referencing these same injection keys.\n\n\nThis represents more of a pull philosophy.  It gives feature-u\nmore knowledge of the process, allowing it to verify that supplied\nresources are correct.\nWildcards (*) can be used to add additional dynamics to the process,\nallowing features to inject their content autonomously.\nHere is a main feature that is pulling in a series of sub-components\n(links and bodies) from other features:\n\nmain feature\nsrc/features/main/feature.js\ncreateFeature({\n  name: 'main',\n\n  fassets: {\n    use: [\n       'MainPage.*.link',\n       'MainPage.*.body',\n    ],\n  },\n  ... snip snip\n});\n\nBecause our specification includes wildcards, a series of\ndefinitions will match!\nHere is the MainPage component that fulfills the usage contract:\nsrc/features/main/comp/MainPage.js\nexport default function MainPage() {\n\n  const fassets = useFassets();\n\n  const Logo       = fassets.get('company.logo');    // from our prior example\n  const mainLinks  = fassets.get('MainPage.*.link'); // find matching\n  const mainBodies = fassets.get('MainPage.*.body');\n\n  return (\n    \n       {/* header section */}\n        \n      \n\n       {/* left-nav section */}\n        {mainLinks.map( (MainLink, indx) => )}\n      \n\n       {/* body section */}\n        {mainBodies.map( (MainBody, indx) => )}\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n\n\nWhen useFassets() (or withFassets()) encounters\nwildcards (*), it merely accumulates all matching definitions, and\npromotes them as arrays.\nThrough this implementation, any feature may dynamically inject\nitself in the process autonomously!  In addition, this dynamic\nimplicitly handles the case where a feature is dynamically disabled\n(very kool indeed)!!\nThe following snippets are taken from other features that supply the\ndefinitions for the content to inject:\n\ncart feature\nsrc/features/cart/feature.js\ncreateFeature({\n  name: 'cart',\n\n  fassets: {\n    defineUse: {\n     'MainPage.cart.link': () => Cart,\n     'MainPage.cart.body': () => ,\n    },\n  },\n  ... snip snip\n});\n\n\nsearch feature\nsrc/features/search/feature.js\ncreateFeature({\n  name: 'search',\n\n  fassets: {\n    defineUse: {\n     'MainPage.search.link': () => Search,\n     'MainPage.search.body': () => ,\n    },\n  },\n  ... snip snip\n});\n\n\n\nTwo external features (cart and search) define the content\nthat is requested by the main feature.\nThe fassets.defineUse directive requires that the resource keys match a\nfassets.use feature request.  This is the contract that provides\nfeature-u insight when enforcing it's validation.\nSideBar: Because we are also dealing with navigation, we introduce\nreact-router into the mix (with the Link and Route\ncomponents).  Because of RR's V4 design, our routes are also handled\nthrough component composition (see Feature Based Routes for\nmore information).\nYou can find more information about this topic in\nUI Composition.\nFeature Enablement\nFeatures can be dynamically disabled by setting the\nFeature.enabled boolean property (part of the\nBuilt-In aspects):\nexport default createFeature({\n  name:     'sandbox',\n  enabled:  false,\n  ... snip snip\n});\n\nIn this example, it is just as though the sandbox feature doesn't\nexist.  In other words it has been logically removed.\nTypically, this indicator is based on some run-time expression,\nallowing packaged code to be dynamically enabled/disabled during the\napplication's start-up process:\nexport default createFeature({\n  name:     'sandbox',\n  enabled:  inDevelopmentMode(),\n  ... snip snip\n});\n\nThis dynamic is useful in a number of different situations. For\nexample:\n\nsome features may require a license upgrade\n\nother features may only be used for diagnostic purposes, and are\ndisabled by default\n\n\nYou can find more information about this topic in\nFeature Enablement.\nIn Summary\nThe following diagram summarizes feature-u's Basic Concepts (as\ndiscussed above):\n\n"},"benefits.html":{"url":"benefits.html","title":"Benefits","keywords":"","body":"Benefits\nThere are many benefits in using feature-u!\nThe two fundamental artifacts from which most benefits are derived\nare:\n\nA formal means by which features can collaborate with one another\n(Cross Feature Communication), making them truly plug-and-play\n\nThis includes the ability for\nUI Composition to cross feature\nboundaries.

It also promotes\nsomething called fassets (feature assets - the Public Face of a\nfeature) with openA() and closeA() functions which will be publicly\npromoted to other features.\nNote: Feature directory imports are redirected to our feature\nobject reference ... for example:\nsrc/features/featureA/index.js\n// redirect parent dir import to our feature reference\nexport {default} from './feature';\n\nFeature Accumulation\nAll features are accumulated through a single es6 module, allowing\nthem to be pulled in through a single array import.\nsrc/features/index.js\nimport featureA  from './featureA';\nimport featureB  from './featureB';\n\n// promote ALL our features through a single import (accumulated in an array)\nexport default [\n  featureA,\n  featureB,\n];\n\nNote: While this represents a complete list of all our features,\nsome of them may be disabled (i.e. logically removed) ... see:\nFeature Enablement.\nlaunchApp()\nIn feature-u the application mainline is very simple and generic.\nThere is no real app-specific code in it ... not even any global\ninitialization!

Aspects\ncan take on many different forms ... for example:\n\nUI Components and Routes, \nState Management (actions, reducers, selectors), \nBusiness Logic, \nStartup Initialization Code, \netc.\n\nNot all aspects are of interest to feature-u ...  only those that\nare needed to setup and launch the app ... all others are\nconsidered to be an internal implementation detail of the feature.  As\nan example, consider the redux state manager: while it uses actions,\nreducers, and selectors ... only reducers are needed to setup and\nconfigure redux.\nfeature-u provides a base set of built-in aspects (out-of-the-box)\nbut allows additional aspects to be introduced through it's extendable\nAPI.\n\nBuilt-In aspects:\nThese aspects are promoted directly by the base feature-u package.\nThey provide very rudimentary capabilities, such as feature\nenablement, Public Face, and application life-cycle hooks.\n\nExtendable aspects:\nThese aspects are promoted by external packages (or self defined\nin your project).  They provide feature-u integration with other\nframeworks (for example redux state management, or\nredux-logic business logic, or navigational routers,\netc.).  They are created with feature-u's extendable API, and are\npackaged separately, so as to not introduce unwanted dependencies.\n\n\n\nFeature Object (relaying aspect content)\nThe Feature object is merely a lightweight container that\nholds AspectContent of interest to feature-u.\nEach feature within an application promotes a Feature object (using\ncreateFeature()) which catalogs the aspects of that feature.\nUltimately, all Feature objects are consumed by launchApp(). \nFeature content are simple key/value pairs (the key being an\nAspect.name with values of AspectContent).  These aspects can\neither be built-in (from core feature-u), or extensions.\nHere is an example:\nexport default createFeature({\n  name:     'featureA', // builtin aspect (name must be unique across all features within app)\n  enabled:  true,       // builtin aspect enabling/disabling feature\n\n  fassets: {            // builtin aspect promoting Public Face - Cross Feature Communication\n    define: {\n      'api.openA':  () => ...,\n      'api.closeA': () => ...,\n    },\n  },\n\n  appWillStart: (...) => ..., // builtin aspect (Application Life Cycle Hook)\n  appInit:      (...) => ..., // ditto\n  appDidStart:  (...) => ..., // ditto\n\n  reducer: ..., // feature redux reducer (extended aspect from the feature-redux plugin)\n  logic:   ..., // feature logic modules (extended aspect from the feature-redux-logic plugin)\n});\n\nBuilt-In aspects\nBuilt-in aspects are promoted directly by the base feature-u package.\nThey provide very rudimentary capabilities, such as feature\nenablement, Public Face, and application life-cycle hooks.\nLike all aspects, Built-In aspect content is relayed through Feature\nobject properties (via createFeature()).\n\nFeature.name\nA string property which represents the identity of the feature.\nFeature names are guaranteed to be unique.  Application code can\nalso use Feature Name in various\nsingle-source-of-truth operations.\n\n\n\nFeature.enabled\nA boolean property that determines whether the feature is enabled or\nnot.  This indicator is typically based on a dynamic expression,\nallowing packaged code to be dynamically enabled/disabled at\nrun-time (please refer to: Feature Enablement).\n\n\n\nFeature.fassets aspect\nAn optional aspect that promotes feature assets used in\nCross Feature Communication (i.e. the Public Face of a feature).\nfassets directives can both define resources, and/or declare a\nresource contract (the intention to use a set of fasset resources).\nResources are accumulated across all features, and exposed through\nthe Fassets object, along with the\nuseFassets() Hook and withFassets() HoC.  For\nmore information, please see Feature.fassets aspect.\n\n\n\nFeature.appWillStart()\nAn optional Application Life Cycle Hook invoked one time, just\nbefore the app starts up.  This life-cycle hook can do any type of\ninitialization, and/or optionally supplement the app's top-level\ncontent (using a non-null return) (please refer to:\nappWillStart).\n\nFeature.appInit()\nAn optional Application Life Cycle Hook invoked one time, later in\nthe app startup process.  This life-cycle hook supports blocking\nasync initialization (by simply returning a promise) (please refer\nto: appInit).\n\nFeature.appDidStart()\nAn optional Application Life Cycle Hook invoked one time,\nimmediately after the app has started.  Because the app is\nup-and-running at this time, you have access to the appState and the\ndispatch() function ... assuming you are using redux (when detected\nby feature-u's plugable aspects) (please refer to:\nappDidStart).\n\n\nExtendable aspects\nfeature-u is extendable!  Extendable Aspects provide feature-u\nintegration with other frameworks (for example redux\nstate management, or redux-logic business logic, etc.).\nFor this reason (by in large) they provide the most value,\nbecause they fully integrate your features into your run-time\nstack!\nExtendable Aspects are packaged separately from feature-u, so as to not\nintroduce unwanted dependencies (because not everyone uses the same\nframeworks).  You pick and choose them based on the framework(s) used\nin your project (matching your project's run-time stack).\nExtendable Aspects are created with feature-u's\nExtension API, using createAspect().  You can\ndefine your own Aspect (if the one you need doesn't already exist)!\nFor more information, please see Extending feature-u.\nLike all aspects, Extendable Aspect content is relayed through Feature\nobject properties (via createFeature()).\nBecause Extendable Aspects are not part of the base feature-u\npackage, it is a bit problematic to discuss them here (they are\neither in a separate npm package, or self contained in your project).\nYou should search the npm registry with the 'feature-u' keyword\nto find the ones that meet your requirements.  With that said, we\nwill briefly discuss the Extendable Aspects that were created in\nconjunction with the initial development of feature-u (just to give\nyou a feel of what is possible).\n\nFeature.reducer via: feature-redux\nfeature-redux is the feature-u integration point\nto redux!\nIt configures redux through the reducerAspect (to be\nsupplied to launchApp()), which extends the Feature object,\nadding support for the Feature.reducer property, referencing\nfeature-based reducers.\nOnly reducers are of interest because that is all that is needed to\nconfigure [redux].  All other redux items (actions, selectors,\netc.) are considered to be an internal implementation detail of the\nfeature.\nThe Feature.reducer content must be embellished by\nslicedReducer(), which provides instructions on how to combine\nmultiple feature-based reducers in constructing the overall\ntop-level application state tree.\nBecause feature-redux manages redux, it also provides an\nintegration hook to other Aspects that need to inject redux\nmiddleware.\nPlease refer to the feature-redux documentation for\ncomplete details.\n\n\n\nFeature.logic via: feature-redux-logic\nfeature-redux-logic is the feature-u integration\npoint to redux-logic!\nIt configures redux-logic through the logicAspect (to be\nsupplied to launchApp()), which extends the Feature object,\nadding support for the Feature.logic property, referencing\nfeature-based logic modules.\nThe following article is an introduction (and motivation) for the\ndevelopment of redux-logic: Where do I put my business logic in a\nReact-Redux\napplication.\nPlease refer to the feature-redux-logic documentation\nfor complete details.\n\n\n\nFeature.route via: feature-router\nfeature-router is the feature-u integration point to\nFeature Routes!\nIt configures Feature Router through the routeAspect (to be\nsupplied to launchApp()), which extends the Feature object,\nadding support for the Feature.route property, referencing routes\ndefined through the featureRoute() function.\nFeature Routes are based on a very simple concept: allow the\napplication state to drive the routes! It operates through a\nseries of registered functional callback hooks, which determine the\nactive screen based on an analysis of the the overall appState.\nThis is particularly useful in feature-based routing, because each\nfeature can promote their own UI components in an encapsulated and\nautonomous way!  Because of this, feature-router is a\npreferred routing solution for feature-u.\nFeature Routes is the recommended solution for feature-based\nnavigation.  You can find more information in the\nFeature Based Routes section.\nPlease refer to the feature-router documentation for\ncomplete details.\n\n\n\nLaunching Your Application\nBy interpreting the set of Features and Aspects that comprise an\napplication, feature-u can actually coordinate the launch of your\napplication (i.e. start it running)!\nThis is accomplished through the launchApp() function.\n\nIt manages the setup and configuration of the frameworks in use,\nsuch as redux, redux-logic, etc.  This is\nbased on a set of supplied plugable Aspects that extend\nfeature-u, integrating external frameworks to match your\nspecific run-time stack.\n\nIt facilitates application life-cycle hooks on the Feature object,\nallowing features to manage things like: initialization and\ninjecting root UI elements, etc.\n\nIt creates and promotes the Fassets object which contains the Public Face\nof all features, facilitating a cross-communication between features.\n\n\nAs a result, your application mainline is very simple and generic.\nThere is no real app-specific code in it ... not even any global\ninitialization!  That is because each feature can inject their own\napp-specific constructs!!  The mainline merely accumulates the\nFeatures and Aspects, and starts the app by invoking launchApp():\nsrc/app.js\nimport React                 from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM              from 'react-dom';\nimport {launchApp}           from 'feature-u';\nimport features              from './features';          // *2*\nimport {createReducerAspect} from 'feature-redux';       // *1*\nimport {createLogicAspect}   from 'feature-redux-logic'; // *1*\nimport {createRouteAspect}   from 'feature-router';      // *1*\nimport SplashScreen {splash} from './util/comp/SplashScreen';\n\n// launch our app, exposing the feature-u Fassets object (facilitating cross-feature-communication)!\nexport default launchApp({         // *4*\n\n  features,                        // *2*\n  aspects: appAspects(),           // *1*\n\n  registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm) { // *3*\n    ReactDOM.render(rootAppElm,\n                    getElementById('myAppRoot'));\n  },\n\n  showStatus(msg='', err=null) {   // *5*\n    splash(msg, err);\n  },\n});\n\n// accumulate/configure the Aspect plugins matching our app's run-time stack\nfunction appAspects() {\n\n  // define our framework run-time stack\n  const reducerAspect = createReducerAspect(); // *1*\n  const logicAspect   = createLogicAspect();   // *1*\n  const routeAspect   = createRouteAspect();   // *1*\n  const aspects = [                            // *1*\n    reducerAspect, // redux          ... extending: Feature.reducer\n    logicAspect,   // redux-logic    ... extending: Feature.logic\n    routeAspect,   // Feature Routes ... extending: Feature.route\n  ];\n\n  // configure Aspects (as needed)\n  // ... StateRouter fallback screen (when no routes are in effect)\n  routeAspect.config.fallbackElm$ = ;\n\n  // beam me up Scotty :-)\n  return aspects;\n}\n\n\nAll of our supplied app features are accumulated from the features/\ndirectory ... (see *2* in the code snippet above).\n\nThe Aspect collection (see *1* in the code snippet above) reflects\nthe frameworks of our run-time stack (in our example\nredux, redux-logic, and\nfeature-router ) and extend the acceptable Feature\nproperties (Feature.reducer, Feature.logic, and Feature.route\nrespectively) ... see: Extendable aspects.\nIn this case, all our Aspects were pulled from external npm packages,\nhowever you can define your own using createAspect().\n\nThe showStatus() callback parameter (see *5* in the\ncode snippet above) uses a SplashScreen to communicate status\nmessages to the end user, resulting from long-running async\nprocesses (like Feature.appInit()).\n\n\nExport fassets\nThe Fassets object (emitted from launchApp())\npromotes the accumulated Public Face of all features.  This is the\nbasis of Cross Feature Communication.\nBy feature-u decree, this object should be exported (see *4*\nin the code snippet above), providing import access to other modules.\nSideBar: In reality there are several ways to access the\nfassets object (depending on the context), import is just one\n(see: Obtaining fassets object).\nYou can find more information about the Fassets object in\nCross Feature Communication.\nReact Registration\nThe launchApp() function uses a\nregisterRootAppElm() callback (see *3* in the code\nsnippet above) to catalog the supplied rootAppElm to the specific\nReact platform in use.\nAPI: registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm, fassets): void\nNOTE regarding the rootAppElm:\n\nTypically the supplied rootAppElm will have definition, based on the\nFeatures and Aspects that are in use.  In this case, it is the\nresponsibility of this callback to register this content in some way\n(either directly or indirectly).\n\nHowever, there are atypical isolated cases where the supplied\nrootAppElm can be null.  This can happen when the app chooses NOT to\nuse Features/Aspects that inject any UI content.  In this case, the\ncallback is free to register it's own content.\n\n\nBecause this registration is accomplished by your app-specific code,\nfeature-u can operate in any of the React platforms, such as:\nReact Web\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n...\nexport default launchApp({\n  features,\n  aspects,\n  registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm) { // *3*\n    ReactDOM.render(rootAppElm,\n                    getElementById('myAppRoot'));\n  }\n});\n\nReact Native\nimport {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';\n...\nexport default launchApp({\n  features,\n  aspects,\n  registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm) { // *3*\n    AppRegistry.registerComponent('myAppKey',\n                                  ()=>rootAppElm); // convert rootAppElm to a React Component\n  }\n});\n\nExpo\nimport Expo from 'expo';\n...\nexport default launchApp({\n  features,\n  aspects,\n  registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm) { // *3*\n    Expo.registerRootComponent(()=>rootAppElm); // convert rootAppElm to a React Component\n  }\n});\n\nCovert Asynchronicity\nIt is worth noting that \"under the covers\" launchApp() is\nactually an asynchronous function, in a \"covert\" sort of way.\nFor simplicity (and backward compatibility), launchApp()\nreturns just before any\nFeature.appInit() / Feature.appDidStart()\nApplication Life Cycle Hooks execute.  The returned\nFassets object is fully resolved and functional.\nHowever, launchApp() is still potentially working in the\nbackground, due to the blocking nature of the asynchronous\nFeature.appInit() Application Life Cycle Hook (introduced in\nV2.1.0).\nThis heuristic has two ramifications:\n\nAny logic that runs after the return of launchApp()\nshould not assume that the app is \"up and running\".  Rather you\nshould rely on the Feature.appDidStart()\nApplication Life Cycle Hook.\nIn reality, this has always been an implicit \"best practice\".\n\nAny errors that occur in the Feature.appInit() life cycle\nmethods (and beyond) are reported via that showStatus()\ncallback.\n\n\nThe bottom line of launchApp() is that it's \"Covert\nAsynchronous\" behavior is \"by design\", because it seems reasonable\n(in the authors opinion), and has the added benefit of being backward\ncompatible to all prior feature-u versions.\n"},"appLifeCycle.html":{"url":"appLifeCycle.html","title":"Application Life Cycle Hooks","keywords":"","body":"Application Life Cycle Hooks\nBecause feature-u is in control of launching your application, it\nhas a unique opportunity to introduce Application Life Cycle\nHooks.  These hooks allow your features to initialize themselves,\nperforming app-specific initialization and even inject static content\nin the root of your DOM.\nThree hooks are provided through the following built-in\nFeature aspects:\n\nFeature.appWillStart - invoked early in app startup (supports accumulative static root DOM injection)\nFeature.appInit           - invoked later in app startup (supports blocking async initialization)\nFeature.appDidStart   - invoked when app startup completes (triggers \"app is running\" processes)\n\n\n\nApplication Life Cycle Hooks greatly simplify your app's mainline\nstartup process, because initialization specific to a given feature\ncan be encapsulated in that feature.\nappWillStart\nThe Feature appWillStart() life-cycle hook is invoked one\ntime, very early in the app startup process.  It supports both general\napp-specific initialization, as well as accumulative static root DOM\ninjection.\nAPI: appWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}): rootAppElm | void\nHere you may perform any type of general initialization that is\nrequired by your feature.  The following example initializes a PWA\nservice worker:\nappWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n  serviceWorker.register();\n}\n\nInjecting DOM Content\nIn addition, the appWillStart() life-cycle hook can\noptionally inject static content in the app's DOM root.  Any return is\ninterpreted as the app's new rootAppElm (an accumulative process\n... see below).\nHere is an example that injects new root-level content:\nappWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n  ... other app-specific initialization here ...\n  return (\n    \n      {curRootAppElm}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nHere is an example of injecting a new sibling to curRootAppElm (using\nReact Fragments):\nappWillStart: ({fassets, curRootAppElm}) => (\n  <>\n    \n    {curRootAppElm}\n  \n)\n\nIMPORTANT: \nYou may have noticed (in the examples above) that injecting DOM\ncontent (via the function return) is an accumulative process.  Any new\nrootAppElm returned from this hook must include the supplied\ncurRootAppElm parameter.\nThe curRootAppElm parameter (when non-null) represents content from\nother features (within your app) or aspects (used by your app).\nAs a result, by including it in your injection, it accommodates the\naccumulative process of other feature/aspect injections!\nThis is outside the control of feature-u, and if you neglect to do\nit, you will be silently dropping content on the floor ... wondering\nwhy some feature/aspect is NOT working.\nThis constraint even extends to cases where the content you are\ninjecting doesn't support children.  In this case you need to throw\nan error, and emit applicable context in a log.\nHere is an example:\nappWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n  // MyContent does NOT support children\n  // ... insure we don't clobber any supplied content\n  if (curRootAppElm) {\n    const msg = \"***ERROR***  does NOT support children \" +\n                \"but another feature/aspect is attempting to inject it's content. \" +\n                \"Please resolve either by adjusting the feature expansion order, \" +\n                \"or promoting  through the conflicting artifact.\";\n    console.log(`${msg} ... conflicting artifact:`, curRootAppElm);\n    throw new Error(msg);\n  }\n  return ;\n}\n\n\nIn many cases (such as a feature conflict), this can be resolved\nby adjusting the feature expansion order.\n\nIn other cases, it may seem as though you have hit an impasse.  For\nexample, if your content doesn't support children, and an aspect\nyou are using doesn't support children.  Normally this doesn't mean\nthat you can't use your component, it merely means that you must\npromote your component in a different way ... most likely through\nthe Aspect in conflict.\n\n\nBecause this check is rather tedious, feature-u provides a\nconvenient assertNoRootAppElm() function that performs this\ncheck on your behalf.  The following code snippet is equivalent:\nappWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n  assertNoRootAppElm(curRootAppElm, ''); // insure no content is clobbered (children NOT supported)\n  return ;\n}\n\nappInit\nThe Feature appInit() life-cycle hook is invoked one time,\nlater in the app startup process.  It supports blocking async\ninitialization.\nAPI: appInit({showStatus, fassets, [appState], [dispatch]}): promise | void\nThis hook is invoked when the app is nearly up-and-running.\n\nThe React Registration has already occurred\n(via the registerRootAppElm() callback).  As a\nresult, you can rely on utilities that require an app-specific\nrootAppElm to exist.\n\nYou have access to the appState and dispatch() function,\nassuming you are using redux (when detected by\nfeature-u's plugable aspects).\n\n\nJust like the appWillStart hook, you may perform\nany type of general initialization that is required by your feature.\nHowever the hallmark of this hook is you can block for any\nasynchronous initialization to complete.  By simply returning a\npromise, feature-u will wait for the process to complete.\nThe user is kept advised of any long-running async processes.  By\ndefault an 'initializing feature: {feature.name}' message is used,\nbut you can customize it through the supplied\nshowStatus() function parameter.\nThe following example shows three processes managed by appInit()\n(one synchronous, and two asynchronous):\nasync appInit({showStatus, fassets, appState, dispatch}) {\n\n  // default view is our TODO List\n  showStatus('Defaulting view to TODO List);\n  dispatch( fassets.actions.changeView('ToDoList') );\n\n  // initialize our DB Connection\n  showStatus('Initializing our DB Connection);\n  await initDB();\n\n  // maintain the current GPS device location in our appState\n  showStatus('Initializing GPS Location');\n  const location = await getCurPos();\n  dispatch( setLocation(location) );\n},\n\nappDidStart\nThe Feature appDidStart() life-cycle hook is invoked one\ntime, once the app startup process has completed.  It can be used to\ntrigger \"the app is running\" events.\nAPI: appDidStart({fassets, [appState], [dispatch]}): void\nBecause the app is up-and-running at this time, you have access to\nthe appState and dispatch() function ... assuming you are using\nredux (when detected by feature-u's plugable\naspects).\nA typical usage for this hook is to \"kick start\" some early\napplication logic.  The following example starts the process of\nauthenticating the user ... either an automatic signin (with saved\ncredentials), or a manual signin (managing the signin screens):\nappDidStart({fassets, appState, dispatch}) {\n  dispatch( actions.authSignIn() );\n}\n\n"},"crossCommunication.html":{"url":"crossCommunication.html","title":"Cross Feature Communication","keywords":"","body":"Cross Feature Communication\nA best practice of feature-based development (to the extent\npossible) is to treat each feature as an isolated implementation.\nMost aspects of a feature are internal to that feature's\nimplementation (for example, actions are typically created and\nconsumed exclusively by logic/reducers/components that are internal to\nthat feature).\nFrom this perspective, you can think of each feature as it's own\nisolated mini application.\nWith that said however, we know that \"no man is an island\"!  Any\ngiven feature ultimately exists as part of a larger application.\nThere are cases where a feature needs to promote a limited subset of\nit's aspects to other features.  For example, a feature may need to:\n\nbe knowledgeable of some external state (via a selector)\nemit or monitor actions of other features\nconsolidate component resources from other features - as in UI Composition\ninvoke the API of other features\netc. etc. etc.\n\nThese items form the basis of why Cross Feature Communication is\nneeded.\nTo complicate matters, as a general rule, JS imports should NOT\ncross feature boundaries.  The reason being that this\ncross-communication should be limited to public access points -\nhelping to facilitate true plug-and-play.\nGiven all this then, how is Cross Feature Communication achieved\nin a way that doesn't break encapsulation?\nFeatures need a way to promote their Public Interface to other\nfeatures, and consume other feature's Public Assets.\nBasic Concepts: fassets\nfeature-u promotes feature-based resources through something\ncalled fassets (feature assets).  This is how all Cross Feature\nCommunication is accomplished.  You can think of this as the Public\nFace of a feature.\nSideBar: The term fassets is a play on words.  While it is\npronounced \"facet\" and is loosely related to this term, it is spelled\nfassets (i.e. feature assets).\nThe fassets terminology is consistently used in both:\n\nthe definition of resources (through the built-in\nFeature.fassets aspect)\n\nand in their usage (through the Fassets object, along\nwith the useFassets() Hook and withFassets()\nHoC)\n\n\n\n\nfassets definition\nA feature can expose whatever it deems necessary through the built-in\nFeature.fassets aspect).  There is no real constraint on this\nresource.  It is truly open.  Typically it is a set of functions or UI\nComponents, but is not limited to that.  It can be a combination of UI\nComponents, actions, selectors, API functions, constants, or whatever\nyour feature needs to promote.\nHere is a simple example of how fassets are defined:\nexport default createFeature({\n\n  name:     'featureA',\n\n  fassets: {\n    define: {\n     'openView':      actions.view.open,      // openView(viewName): Action\n     'currentView':   selector.currentView,   // currentView(appState): viewName\n     'isDeviceReady': selector.isDeviceReady, // isDeviceReady(appState): boolean\n    },\n  },\n\n  ...\n});\n\nAs you can see, the fassets aspect has a define\ndirective where resources are cataloged.\nIn this example, featureA is publicly promoting only three of\nit's many internal aspects ...  one action creator (openView) and\ntwo selectors (currentView, and isDeviceReady).\nfassets usage\nTo use these public resources, feature-u accumulates them from all\nactive features, and promotes them through the\nFassets object (emitted from launchApp()).\nSideBar: There are several ways to obtain access the Fassets object\n(discussed later - Obtaining fassets object).\nTo reference a fassets resource, simply dereference it as any other\nobject reference.  Here is a usage example (using the definition\nabove):\n  fassets.isDeviceReady(appState)\n\nNOTE: In addition to directly dereferencing a resource on the\nfassets object, you can also use the Fassets.get() method\nalong with the useFassets() Hook and\nwithFassets() HoC (discussed later).  One advantage of\nthese alternatives is you can utilize wildcards to match multiple\nfasset resources.\nfederated namespace\nfasset keys may contain a federated namespace (using dots -\n.). When this is done, feature-u will normalize them in a\nstructure with depth.\nYou can use federated names however you wish, or not at all.  In\ngeneral it helps categorize or qualify assets in some way.  You may\nwant to qualify by feature name, or process type, or any app-specific\nstructure.\nAs an example, the following define was enhanced (from above) to\ninclude some qualifiers:\nexport default createFeature({\n\n  name:     'featureA',\n\n  fassets: {\n    define: {\n     'action.openView':        actions.view.open,      // openView(viewName): Action\n     'selector.currentView':   selector.currentView,   // currentView(appState): viewName\n     'selector.isDeviceReady': selector.isDeviceReady, // isDeviceReady(appState): boolean\n    },\n  },\n\n  ...\n});\n\nand would be referenced as follows:\n  fassets.selector.isDeviceReady(appState)\n\nUI Composition\nA major benefit of working with React is components.  Components allow\nyou to split your UI into independent, reusable pieces.\nDepending on your feature boundaries, it is very common for a given\ncomponent to be an accumulation of sub-components that span several\nfeatures.  As a result, UI Composition is a very important part of\nCross Feature Communication.\nLet's build some concepts by looking at series of examples.\nConsider a common feature that promotes a series of central\nresources, used throughout our application.  The following snippet\ndemonstrates how a company logo could be promoted to several UI\ncomponents.\ncreateFeature({\n\n  name: 'common',\n\n  fassets: {\n    define: {\n     'company.logo': () => , // a react component\n    },\n  },\n  ... snip snip\n});\n\nSo far nothing new has been introduced in this example.  This is the\nsame type of resource definition that we have seen previously ... it's\njust the resource happens to be a react component.\nuseFassets() Hook\nuseFassets() is a feature-u React Hook that\nprovides functional component access to fassets.\nHooks is an exciting React feature that allows you to \"hook\ninto\" React state and lifecycle aspects from functional\ncomponents.\nHere is how a component would access a company.logo (defined\nabove) using Hooks:\nexport default function MyComponent() {\n\n  const Logo = useFassets('company.logo');\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n    ... snip snip\n  );\n}\n\nIn this example, because the Logo property is a component,\nMyComponent can simply reference it using JSX.\nwithFassets() HoC\nwithFassets() is a feature-u Higher-order Component\n(HoC) that auto-wires fasset properties into a component.  This is a\ncommon pattern popularized by redux connect() (simplifying\ncomponent access to application state).\nHere is the same example (from above) using withFassets():\nfunction MyComponent({Logo}) {\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n    ... snip snip\n  );\n}\n\nexport default withFassets({\n  component: MyComponent,\n  mapFassetsToProps: {\n    Logo: 'company.logo',\n  }\n});\n\nThe withFassets() HoC auto-wires named feature assets as\ncomponent properties through the mapFassetsToProps hook.  In this\nexample, because the Logo property is a component, MyComponent can\nsimply reference it using JSX.\nResource Contracts\nIt is common for UI Composition to be represented as a contract, where\na component in one feature has a series of injection needs that are to\nbe supplied by other features.\nThe fassets aspect has additional constructs to facilitate\nthis contractual arrangement, allowing feature-u to provide more\nvalidation in the process.\nRather than just defining resources in one feature and using them in\nanother:\n\nA given feature can specify a series of injection needs using the\nfassets.use directive.  This identifies a set of injection keys\nthat uniquely identify these resources.\n\nOther features will supply this content using the fassets.defineUse\ndirective, by referencing these same injection keys.\n\n\nThis represents more of a pull philosophy.  It gives feature-u\nmore knowledge of the process, allowing it to verify that supplied\nresources are correct.\nSideBar: The define and defineUse directives are very similar,\nand in some cases can be used interchangeably.  The defineUse\ndirective does everything define does but enforces the additional\nconstraint that it must match a corresponding use request.\nTherefore, if your intent is to to supply content that is formally\nrequested by another feature (via the use directive), defineUse is\npreferred (even though it can be accomplished by define),\nbecause typos can be caught on the definition side.\nFollowing is a composition example that uses this more formal definition.\nIn this example our application has a MainPage, that promotes a\nvariety of sub-components: a ShoppingCart and a Search screen.\nBecause these sub-components are managed by separate features, we need\na way to pull them into the MainPage.\nHere is our main feature:\n\nmain feature\nsrc/features/main/feature.js\ncreateFeature({\n  name: 'main',\n\n  fassets: {\n    use: [ // \nThe main feature simply specifies it's need for externally sourced\nsub-content.  This is a contract (so to speak) stating that it plans\nto render this content.\nHere is the manifestation of this contract:\nsrc/features/main/comp/MainPage.js\nexport default function MainPage() {\n\n  const Logo = useFassets('company.logo'); // from our prior example\n\n  const CartLink = useFassets('MainPage.cart.link');\n  const CartBody = useFassets('MainPage.cart.body');\n\n  const SearchLink = useFassets('MainPage.search.link');\n  const SearchBody = useFassets('MainPage.search.body');\n\n  return (\n    \n       {/* header section */}\n        \n      \n\n       {/* left-nav section */}\n        \n        \n      \n\n       {/* body section */}\n        \n        \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThe following snippets are taken from other features that supply the\ndefinitions for the content to inject:\n\ncart feature\nsrc/features/cart/feature.js\ncreateFeature({\n  name: 'cart',\n\n  fassets: {\n    defineUse: {\n     'MainPage.cart.link': () => Cart,\n     'MainPage.cart.body': () => ,\n    },\n  },\n  ... snip snip\n});\n\n\nsearch feature\nsrc/features/search/feature.js\ncreateFeature({\n  name: 'search',\n\n  fassets: {\n    defineUse: {\n     'MainPage.search.link': () => Search,\n     'MainPage.search.body': () => ,\n    },\n  },\n  ... snip snip\n});\n\n\n\nTwo external features (cart and search) define the content\nthat is requested by the main feature.\nThe fassets.defineUse directive requires that the resource keys match a\nfassets.use feature request.  This is the contract that provides\nfeature-u insight when enforcing it's validation.\nSideBar: Because we are also dealing with navigation, we introduce\nreact-router into the mix (with the Link and Route\ncomponents).  Because of RR's V4 design, our routes are also handled\nthrough component composition (see Feature Based Routes for\nmore information).\nWildcards (adding dynamics)\nIn our prior example we explicitly define each injection key, and\nstrategically place it in our parent component.  While this may be\nnecessary in some cases, typically more dynamics are required\n(allowing features to introduce their content autonomously).\nThis can be accomplished by using wildcards (*).\nHere is our refined main feature (NOTE: the definitions\nfrom the defining features are the same, so they are not repeated):\n\nmain feature\nsrc/features/main/feature.js\ncreateFeature({\n  name: 'main',\n\n  fassets: {\n    use: [\n       'MainPage.*.link',\n       'MainPage.*.body',\n    ],\n  },\n  ... snip snip\n});\n\nBecause our specification includes wildcards, a series of\ndefinitions will match!\nHere is our refined MainPage component:\nsrc/features/main/comp/MainPage.js\nexport default function MainPage() {\n\n  const Logo = useFassets('company.logo'); // from our prior example\n\n  const mainLinks  = useFassets('MainPage.*.link'); // find matching\n  const mainBodies = useFassets('MainPage.*.body');\n\n  return (\n    \n       {/* header section */}\n        \n      \n\n       {/* left-nav section */}\n        {mainLinks.map( (MainLink, indx) => )}\n      \n\n       {/* body section */}\n        {mainBodies.map( (MainBody, indx) => )}\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n\n\nWhen useFassets() (or withFassets()) encounters wildcards (*), it merely\naccumulates all matching definitions, and promotes them as arrays.\nOur MainPage component no longer explicitly reasons about each\ninjection.\nSideBar: Notice that our mapping process used the array index\nfor our React key.  This technique actually works in a majority of\ncases, because the set of fassets \"in use\" typically does not\nchange.  With that said, there is an alternate approach (using the\n@withKeys directive) that injects the unique fassetsKey into the\nmix.  Please refer to: React Keys (in array processing).\nThrough this implementation, any feature may dynamically inject\nitself in the process autonomously!  In addition, this dynamic\nimplicitly handles the case where a feature is dynamically disabled\n(very kool indeed)!!\nWildcard Processing\nThis section provides additional detail related to wildcard\nprocessing.  For the examples below, please assume the following\nresource definitions:\nfassetsKey             Resource\n=====================  ========\n'company.logo'            1\n'MainPage.cart.link'      2\n'MainPage.cart.body'      3\n'MainPage.search.link'    4\n'MainPage.search.body'    5\n'my.fun.object'           6 ... { greet: 'hello' }\nWildcard Characters:\nCurrently, only one wildcard character is supported:\n\n*: Matches zero or more characters.  Can also span multiple nodes\n(i.e. the dots . of a federated namespace).\nExamples:\nfassetsKey             Matches\n=====================  =============\n'company.logo'         1\n'*link'                [  2,  4    ]\n'MainPage.*.link'      [  2,  4    ]\n'MainPage.*.body'      [    3,  5  ]\n'MainPage.*'           [  2,3,4,5  ]\n'*a*'                  [1,2,3,4,5  ]\n'*'                    [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n'ouch'                 undefined\n'WowZee*WooWoo'        []\n\n\nWildcard Matching:\nThe following pattern matching rules are in effect:\n\nPattern matching is case-sensitive.  It is worth noting that\nfassetsKey definitions are also case-sensitive.\nExamples:\nfassetsKey             Matches\n=====================  ===========\n'MainPage.*.link'      [2,4]\n'mainPage.*.link'      []\n\nBy default, the entire entry is matched. In other words an\nimplicit start/end anchor is applied.  This heuristic can be\naltered by simply injecting wildcards at the start/end of your\nexpression.\nExamples:\nfassetsKey             Matches\n=====================  ===========\n'Page.*.link'          []\n'*Page.*.link'         [2,4]\n\nMatches are restricted to the actual fassetKeys registered through\nthe fassets aspect define/defineUse directives.  In\nother words, the matching algorithm will not drill into the\nresource itself (assuming it is an object with depth).\nExamples:\nfassetsKey             Matches\n=====================  ==========================\n'my.*.object'          [6] ... { greet: 'hello' }\n'my.*.object.greet'    []\n\n\nResource Order (in wildcard processing)\nThe order in which resources are promoted when wildcards are in use,\nis feature expansion order.  In other words, the same order that\nfeatures are registered.\nReact Keys (in array processing)\nAs you probably already know, React requires a key attribute when\ninjecting elements of an array.\nYou may have noticed (in the wildcard example - above), we are using\narray indices for our keys.  In some cases this may be considered an\nanti-pattern, leading to inefficiencies in DOM reconciliation. It\nreally depends on the mutability status of the array. Remember, the\nkey must only be unique among its siblings - not globally (please\nrefer to the React docs\nhere).\nIn the case of fasset usage, key indices will in fact work in most\ncases - assuming there is no variability in the promoted set of\nfasset resources (a normal case).\nIf however there is some conditional logic involved, you may request\nuseFassets() and withFassets() to supply a [fassetsKey, resource] pair, by\nusing the @withKeys suffix.  This is an ideal solution because\nfeature-u guarantees fassetsKey to be unique.\n// mapping snippet ...\n   mainLinks:  'MainPage.*.link@withKeys', // @withKeys: request [fassetsKey, resource] pairs\n                // mainLinks:  [['MainPage.cart.link',   cartLinkResource],\n                //              ['MainPage.search.link', searchLinkResource]],\n\n// array injection snippet ...\n   {mainLinks.map( ([fassetsKey, MainLink]) => )}\n\nResource Validation\nResource validations can optionally be specified through the\nfassets aspect use directive.  This includes:\n\noptionality (required/optional) \nand data type/content\n\nBy default, the use directive simply accepts an array of strings\n(the resources keys which will be used).  This represents resources\nthat are required of type any.  You can change this default by\nreplacing each string with a two element array containing the resource\nkey followed by an options object:\n[ '$fassetsKey', {           // resource key with options object\n  required:   true/false,    // DEFAULT: true\n  type:       $validationFn, // DEFAULT: any\n}]\n\n\nRequired items disallow the undefined value.\n\nType/content validation is specified through a function reference.\nYou may define your own validations, or use one of the canned\nvalidators provided by feature-u.  Please refer to\nfassetValidations for a list of the pre-defined\nvalidators, as well as the validation API.\n\n\nHere is an example that employs validations.  Notice the mix of both\nstrings (with their default semantics), and the options object\n(specifying the validation constraints):\ncreateFeature({\n  fassets: {\n    use: [\n       'MainPage.*.link', // DEFAULT: required of type any\n      ['MainPage.*.body', {required: false, type: fassetValidations.comp}],\n    ],\n  },\n});\n\nDoes Feature Exist\nThe Fassets object can be used to determine if a feature\nis present or not.  If a feature does not exist, or has been disabled,\nthe Fassets.hasFeature() will return false.\n\nIt could be that featureA will conditionally use featureB if it\nis present.\nif (fassets.hasFeature('featureB') {\n  ... do something featureB related\n}\n\n\nIt could be that featureC unconditionally requires that featureD\nis present.  This can be checked in the appWillStart()\nApplication Life Cycle Hook.\nappWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n  assert(fassets.hasFeature('featureD'), '***ERROR*** I NEED featureD');\n}\n\n\n\nNOTE: In addition to fassets.hasFeature(featureName) it is also\npossible to reason over the existence of well-known fasset resources\nthat are specific to a feature.\nfassets recap: Push or Pull\nAt this point, it may be useful to summarize the three\nfassets aspect directives: define, use, and\ndefineUse ... highlighting two broad use cases.\nAs it turns out, when it comes to the definition and consumption of\nfasset resources (covered in the prior sections), there are two\nbroad philosophies: push or pull.\n\nPush - \"throw it over the wall\" \n\nDefinition:\nWhen defining resources in a push philosophy the define\ndirective is crucial.  Here the supplier is simply publicly promoting\na resource for other features to use (take it or leave it).  The\nsupplier is merely saying: \"this is my Public Face\".\n\nConsumption:\nNormally, in a push philosophy, the consumer simply accesses\nthe resource without any use directive (through\nFassets object or useFassets() Hook and withFassets() HoC).\nOptionally however, the consumer may employ the use directive.\nHere they are simply providing feature-u with more information,\nso the system will fail fast (at startup time) when the resource\nis not defined.  In other words, there would never be a need for the\nconsumer to check if the resource is defined (assuming the use\ncontract is \"required\").  Rather, that constraint is achieved by\nfeature-u.  Note: This scenario highlights that multiple\nfeatures can specify the same use directive, providing their\nResource Validation does not conflict.\n\n\n\nPull ... \"a resource contract\" \n\nConsumption:\nWhen using a pull philosophy, the use directive is more\ncritical.  In this case the consumer is saying: \"I plan to use this\nresource from whatever feature(s) wish to supply it\".  This is the\nfirst half of a Resource Contract!\nTypically a use contract is made with wildcards, although not\nrequired.  Wildcards allow external features to inject their\ncontent autonomously.\nSideBar: It is important that the consumer fulfill this\ncontract by programmatically accessing the resource defined in it's\nuse contract (through Fassets object or\nuseFassets() Hook and withFassets() HoC).  This is outside the control of\nfeature-u.\n\nDefinition:\nWhen defining a resource in the pull philosophy, the supplier\nshould use the defineUse directive (even though a define\nwould technically work).  Here the supplier is saying \"I am\nsupplying this resource under contract\".  In this case the system\nwill fail fast (at startup time) if there is NO fulfillment of\nthis contract (for example a typo).\n\n\n\n\nObtaining fassets object\nBroadly speaking, Public Facing fasset resources can be obtained\neither by:\n\nusing the useFassets() Hook (for UI Components),\n\nusing the withFassets() HoC (for UI Components),\n\nor by directly referencing the Fassets object\nprogrammatically.\n\n\nThe first two options implicitly accesses fassets (under the covers) using a\nreact context.  The last option requires direct programmatic\naccess to the Fassets object ... of which there are five\nways to achieve:\n\nUse the fassets parameter supplied through\nfeature-u's programmatic APIs ... for code that is under the\ncontrol of feature-u (for example, life-cycle hooks, or logic\nhooks, etc.).\n\nObtain fassets from Hooks ... for react\ncomponents (using the special useFassets() '.'\nkeyword, obtaining the fassets object itself).\n\nInject fassets comp props ... for react\ncomponents (using the special withFassets() '.'\nkeyword, injecting the fassets object itself).\n\nUse Managed Code Expansion ... for\nAspectContent definitions requiring fassets during\ninline code-expansion (employing the\nexpandWithFassets() wrapper function).\n\nimport fassets from your application\nmainline ... for code that is outside the control of feature-u\n(providing the reference is not needed during inline\ncode-expansion).\n\n\nYou may be asking yourself: \"Why so many techniques\"?  Let's\ndelve into this just a bit ...\nGenerally speaking, programmatic access to the\nFassets object is complicated by whether it is needed\nduring inline code-expansion or not.\n\nThe fact that launchApp() accumulates fasset resources,\nmeans that it must run to completion before fassets is made\navailable through an import.\n\nFurthermore, the goal of restricting cross-feature imports requires\nthat the fassets object be used in place of imports.\n\n\nIn spite of these seemingly conflicting artifacts, the goal of\nrestricting cross-feature imports is most certainly a worthy\nobjective! The bottom line is that\nManaged Code Expansion comes to the rescue, and\n\"fills the gap\" when needed.\nAccessing external feature resources in a seamless way is a\nrudimentary benefit of feature-u that alleviates a number of\nproblems in your code, making your features truly plug-and-play.\nSideBar: It is possible that a module may be using more than one of\nthese access techniques.  As an example a logic module may have to use\nexpandWithFassets() to access fassets at code-expansion\ntime, but is also supplied fassets as a parameter in it's functional\nhook.  This is perfectly fine, as they will be referencing the exact\nsame fassets object instance.\nLet's take a closer look at each of these access points.\n\nfassets parameter\nThe simplest way to access the Fassets object is through\nthe programmatic APIs of feature-u, where fassets is supplied as\na parameter.  This covers any process that is under the control of\nfeature-u, for example:\n\napp life-cycle hooks:\n\nappWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}): rootAppElm | void\nappInit({showStatus, fassets, [appState], [dispatch]}): promise | void\nappDidStart({fassets, [appState], [dispatch]}): void\n\n\n\n\nroute hooks (PKG: feature-router):\nrouteCB({fassets, appState}): rendered-component (null for none)\n\n\nlogic hooks (PKG: redux-logic):\ncreateLogic({\n  ...\n  transform({getState, action, fassets}, next) {\n    ...\n  },\n  process({getState, action, fassets}, dispatch, done) {\n    ...\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nObtain fassets from Hooks\nFor react functional components, you can obtain the\nFassets object by using the special\nuseFassets() '.' keyword.  This emits the fassets\nobject itself (in the same tradition as \"current directory\").\nNOTE that this is also the same result of not passing any\nparameter to useFassets().\nWhen using the useFassets() Hook you have a choice ... you\ncan obtain the selected assets as needed, or the the entire fassets\nobject, or both ... it's really a personal preference.\nHere is an example:\nexport default function MyComp() {\n\n  const fassets  = useFassets('.'); // same as: useFassets()\n  const Logo     = fassets.company.logo;\n                   // ... React's useSelector()\n  const eggCount = useSelector((appState) => fassets.selectors.getEggCount(appState), [fassets]);\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n      My egg total: {eggCount}\n    \n    ... can use fassets here too (if desired)\n  );\n};\n\n\nInject fassets comp props\nFor react components, you can inject the Fassets object\ndirectly in your component properties by using the special\nwithFassets() '.' keyword.  This emits the fassets\nobject itself (in the same tradition as \"current directory\").\nWhen using the withFassets() HoC you have a choice ... you\ncan inject selected assets as needed, or the the entire fassets\nobject, or both ... it's really a personal preference.\nAs it turns out, this can even be used to introduce fassets into\nother HoCs, such as redux connect() using it's ownProps parameter.\nHere is an example:\nconst MyComp = ({fassets, Logo, eggCount}) => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      My egg total: {eggCount}\n    \n    ... can use fassets here too (if desired)\n  );\n};\n\nconst MyConnectedComp = connect( // standard redux connect\n (state, {fassets}) => ({ // ... fassets available in ownProps (via withFassets() below)\n   eggCount: fassets.selectors.getEggCount(state), // ... uses external feature selector (via fassets)\n }),\n)(MyComp);\n\nexport default withFassets({\n  mapFassetsToProps: {\n    fassets: '.', // ... introduce fassets into props via the '.' keyword\n    Logo:    'company.logo',\n  }\n})(MyConnectedComp);\n\nIf you are of a \"functional\" mindset, here is the same example using\nfunctional composition:\nimport {compose} from 'redux';\n\nconst MyComp = ({fassets, Logo, eggCount}) => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      My egg total: {eggCount}\n    \n    ... can use fassets here too (if desired)\n  );\n};\n\nexport default compose( // combine withFassets() and redux connect() using functional composition\n  withFassets({\n    mapFassetsToProps: {\n      fassets: '.', // ... introduce fassets into props via the '.' keyword\n      Logo:    'company.logo',\n    },\n  }),\n  connect((state, {fassets}) => ({ // ... fassets available in ownProps (via withFassets())\n    eggCount: fassets.selectors.getEggCount(state), // ... uses external feature selector (via fassets)\n  })),\n)(MyComp);\n\n\nManaged Code Expansion\nTo obtain early access to the Fassets object (during\ninline code-expansion), simply wrap your AspectContent\nin the expandWithFassets() utility.\nThere are two situations that make accessing fassets problematic,\nwhich are: a: in-line code expansion (where fassets may not\nbe fully defined), and b: order dependencies (across\nfeatures).\nTo illustrate this, the following redux-logic module is\nmonitoring an action defined by an external feature (see *1*).\nBecause this fassets reference is made during code expansion time, the\nimport will not work, because the fassets object has not yet been fully\ndefined.  This is a timing issue.\nimport fassets from '~/app'; // *1*\n\nexport const myLogicModule = createLogic({\n\n  name: 'myLogicModule',\n  type: String(fassets.featureB.actions.fooBar), // *1* fassets NOT defined during in-line expansion\n\n  process({getState, action}, dispatch, done) {\n    ... \n  },\n\n});\n\nWhen AspectContent definitions require the\nFassets object at code expansion time, you can wrap the\ndefinition in a expandWithFassets() function.  In other\nwords, your aspect content can either be the actual content itself\n(ex: a reducer), or a function that returns the content.\nYour callback function should conform to the following signature:\nAPI: expandWithFassetsCB(fassets): AspectContent\nWhen this is done, feature-u will invoke the\nexpandWithFassetsCB() in a controlled way, passing the fully\nresolved Fassets object as a parameter.\nTo accomplish this, you must wrap your expansion function with the the\nexpandWithFassets() utility.  The reason for this is that\nfeature-u must be able to distinguish a\nexpandWithFassetsCB() function from other functions (ex:\nreducers).\nHere is the same example (from above) that that fixes our\nproblem by replacing the fassets import with expandWithFassets():\n                             // *1* we replace fassets import with expandWithFassets()\nexport const myLogicModule = expandWithFassets( (fassets) => createLogic({\n\n  name: 'myLogicModule',\n  type: String(fassets.featureB.actions.fooBar), // *1* fassets now is fully defined\n\n  process({getState, action}, dispatch, done) {\n    ... \n  },\n\n}) );\n\nBecause expandWithFassetsCB() is invoked in a controlled way\n(by feature-u), the supplied fassets parameter is guaranteed to be\ndefined (issue a).  Not only that, but the supplied fassets object\nis guaranteed to have all public facing feature definitions resolved\n(issue b).\nSideBar: A secondary reason expandWithFassets() may be\nused (over and above fassets injection during code expansion) is to\ndelay code expansion, which can avoid issues related to\n(legitimate but somewhat obscure) circular dependencies.\n\nimport fassets\nFor run-time functions that are outside the control of feature-u,\nsimply import fassets from your application mainline.\nYour mainline exports the launchApp() return value\n... which is the Fassets object.\nsrc/app.js\n// launch our app, exposing the feature-u Fassets object (facilitating cross-feature communication)!\nexport default launchApp({\n  ...\n});\n\nWhile imports are a simple and straight forward process, they cannot be\nused when the reference is needed during inline code-expansion\n(because launchApp() must run to completion).\n\nAs it turns out, importing fassets is not usually necessary, because\nmost cases are covered through the alternate means.\nFor sake of example, let's consider a somewhat contrived example,\nwhere a piece of code needs to close the leftNav menu.  This function\nis provided by a Public Facing resource defined in the leftNav\nfeature.\nimport fassets from '../app';\n\nfunction closeSideBar() {\n  fassets.leftNav.close();\n}\n\n"},"featureRouter.html":{"url":"featureRouter.html","title":"Feature Based Routes","keywords":"","body":"Feature Based Routes\nOnce your application grows to more than a few pages, the need for a\nrouting solution becomes critical.  Which one do you use?  There are\nso many!\nTrue to feature-u's ideology, no one routing solution is mandated.\nYou are free to pick and choose whichever of the many solutions meet\nyour needs.\nWith the advent of feature-u's V1 approach to\nCross Feature Communication, it is now possible to integrate to a number\nof the routing solutions available today out-of-the-box!\nBy using a pull philosophy in accumulating\nresources over your features, you can easily gather a collection of\nlinks for your menus and the route components themselves.  This\nsolution employs Resource Contracts and\nWildcard Processing through the\nFassets.get() and useFassets()/withFassets() access points.\nUsing this technique, you can accumulate your routing resources\nautonomously, allowing your app to grow feature by feature, not\nneeding to know everything in advance.  All that is needed is to adopt\na naming convention (publicly promoted through the\nfassets aspect use directive - a\nResource Contract) for your links and route\ncomponents.\nSideBar: While your routing solution may involve a feature-u\nplugin (Extendable aspects), for the most part\nfeature-u's Cross Feature Communication should go a long way in\nsupport of router integration out-of-the-box.\nThis section will briefly look at how feature-u projects can\nintegrate with two different routing solutions (the \"tried and true\"\nreact-router, and a \"new approach\" based\non state: feature-router).\nreact-router\nreact-router V4 makes it very simple to perform\nrouting. By injecting a  component at the root of your\napplication, your  components can can live anywhere in the\ntree. In turn,  components make it easy to navigate to the\nvarious routes.\nIn this example, we employ an app feature that has two\nresponsibilities:\n\npromote our top-level  component, and\nmanage our application routes.\n\nLet's walk through this implementation, step by step ...\nStep One (basic  injection):\nThe first goal of our app feature is to promote the top-level\n component.  This is easily accomplished by using\nfeature-u's Application Life Cycle Hooks.\nHere are the code snippets that implement this first goal.\nsrc/features/app/featureName.js see: Best Practices Feature Name\n/**\n * Expose our featureName through a mini-meta module that is\n * \"importable\" in all use-cases (a single-source-of-truth).\n */\nexport default 'app';\n\nsrc/features/app/comp/App.js our top-level  component\nimport React from 'react';\n\n/**\n * Our top-level App component (just a start).\n */\nexport default App = () => Hello World;\n\nNow we simply promote the  component into the DOM using our\nFeature.appWillStart() Application Life Cycle Hook.\nsrc/features/app/feature.js our app Feature, promoting the  component\nimport React           from 'react';\nimport {createFeature} from 'feature-u';\nimport App             from './comp/App;\nimport featureName     from './featureName';\n\nexport default createFeature({\n\n  name: featureName,\n\n  appWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n    assertNoRootAppElm(curRootAppElm, ''); // insure no content is clobbered (children NOT supported)\n    return ;\n  }\n});\n\nStep Two (adding links and routes):\nThe second goal of our app feature is to manage our application\nlinks and routes.\nOur app feature accomplishes this by introducing a\nResource Contract, where we pull in links and\nroutes under the following naming convention:\n\n*.link.comp - any fasset resource suffixed with .link.comp is\nexpected to be a  component, and will be displayed in the\nApp header menu.\n\n*.route.comp - any fasset resource suffixed with .route.comp is\nexpected to be a  component, which will be rendered when\nthe application navigates to a matching route.\n\n\nHere is our app feature with it's newly enhanced usage contract (see\nuse directive):\nsrc/features/app/feature.js our app Feature, enhanced with the new usage contract\nimport React                from 'react';\nimport {createFeature,\n        assertNoRootAppElm} from 'feature-u';\nimport App                  from './comp/App;\nimport featureName          from './featureName';\n\nexport default createFeature({\n\n  name: featureName,\n\n  fassets: {          // NEW:\n    use: [            // our usage contract\n      '*.link.comp',  // ... link components\n      '*.route.comp'  // ... route components\n    ]\n  },\n\n  appWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n    assertNoRootAppElm(curRootAppElm, ''); // insure no content is clobbered (children NOT supported)\n    return ;\n  }\n});\n\nAnd here is the fulfillment of our contract ... the enhanced \ncomponent (with links and routes).\nsrc/features/app/comp/App.js our top-level  component with links and routes\nimport React           from 'react';\nimport {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';\nimport {useFassets}    from 'feature-u;\n\n/**\n * Our top-level App component (with links and routes)!\n */\nexport default function App() {\n\n  const linkComps  = useFassets('*.link.comp');\n  const routeComps = useFassets('*.route.comp');\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n        \n          My App\n          { linkComps.map( (LinkComp, indx) => ) }\n        \n        \n          { routeComps.map( (RouteComp, indx) => ) }\n        \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nNotice that in support of react-router, we wrap everything\nwith .\nAlso notice that we inject the needed fasset resources using the\nuseFassets() Hook.\nBecause our mapping uses wildcards, many resources will match\n(accumulated into arrays).  We simply inject the resources into our\ncomponent using array iteration.\nSideBar: In regard to the react key using an array indices, please\n see: React Keys (in array processing).\nSuppliers (supplying content to the resource contract)\nBy employing wildcards, these links and routes can be supplied by\nany of our features - autonomously!!\nThe order in which these resources appear (when using wildcards) are\nfeature expansion order (i.e. the same order that features are\nregistered).\nHere is a foo feature that supplies it's own link and route\ncomponents.\nsrc/features/foo/feature.js a foo feature supplying links and routes\nimport React           from 'react';\nimport {createFeature} from 'feature-u';\nimport {Link, Route}   from 'react-router-dom';\nimport featureName     from './featureName'; // 'foo' ... a single-source-of-truth mini-meta module\n\nconst featureURLPath = `/${featureName}`; // the URL path is /foo\n\nconst link      = () => Foo;\nconst component = () =>  Foo }/>;\n\nexport default createFeature({\n  name: featureName,\n\n  fassets: {\n    defineUse: { // KEY: supply content under contract of the app feature\n      [`${featureName}.link.comp`]:  link,\n      [`${featureName}.route.comp`]: component\n    }\n  }\n\n});\n\nNotice that we are using the defineUse directive (even though a\ndefine would technically work).  This indicates that we are\nsupplying this resource \"under contract\" (i.e. it should match a\ncorresponding use directive).  This allows feature-u to fail\nfast if there is a problem (for example a misspelling).\nSumming it up:\nThat's all there is to it. As we add features with links and route\ncomponents, they are automatically picked up and rendered to our\napp!!\nfeature-u's wildcard support makes it easy to support most any\nuse case you might need.  It is nice that we don't have to keep\nmodifying  when we want to add a new menu link or another\nroute. Just by adhering to our naming convention they are\nautomatically pulled in and used.\nfeature-router\nfeature-router (a feature-u plugin, packaged\nseparately) represents a new twist on routing.\nFeature Routes are based on a very simple concept: allow the\napplication state to drive the routes!\nIt operates through a series of feature-based routing functions that\nreason about the appState, and either return a rendered component, or\nnull to allow downstream routes the same opportunity.  Basically the\nfirst non-null return wins.\nIn feature based routing, you will not find the typical \"route path to\ncomponent\" mapping catalog, where (for example) some pseudo\nroute('signIn') directive causes the SignIn screen to display\n(which in turn causes the system to accommodate the request by\nadjusting it's state).\nIn other words, you will never see application logic that re-routes to\na signIn screen after checking to see if the user is authenticated.\nRather, the appState is king!  If the user is NOT authenticated\n(based on the route's analysis of the appState) the SignIn screen is\nautomatically displayed ... Easy Peasy!\nDepending on your perspective, this approach can be more robust and\nnatural.\nWant to see an example?  Because feature-router was\nbuilt as a feature-u plugin, you can find examples directly in\nit's documentation.\nPlease Note that it is possible to use feature-router\nin conjunction with other routing solutions!\nSideBar: Another characteristic of this routing plugin is it\nallows features to promote their own screens in an encapsulated and\nautonomous way!  As we have seen, this goal can also be accomplished\nthrough feature-u's V1 approach to Cross Feature Communication\nThis discussion is obviously an introduction.  There is more to this\nplugin that we haven't touched on.

For\nexample:\n\nsome features may require a license upgrade\n\nother features may only be used for diagnostic purposes, and are\ndisabled by default\n\n\nHow does it work?\nBecause feature-u is responsible for aggregating assets across all\nfeatures, it's a very simple process to disable a feature ... the\nfeatures supplied to launchApp() are merely pruned to a set\nof active features.  It's just as though disabled features never\nexisted (logically).\nTo fully understand how this works, consider the following\ncharacteristics of a disabled feature (read this table like a\nsentence ... injecting the header in front of each column):\n\n\n\ndisabled features with ...\nnever registers the feature's ...\ntherefore, the feature's:\n\n\n\n\nlife cycle hooks\ncallbacks\ninitialization code never executes\n\n\nfassets\nPublic Face\nPublic Face doesn't exist\n\n\nstate management\nreducers\nstate doesn't exist\n\n\nlogic\nlogic modules\nlogic is never executed\n\n\nfeature routes\nroutes\nscreens are never presented\n\n\netc.\netc.\netc.\n\n\n\nThe internal implementation of Feature Enablement is extremely\nstraightforward!  The underlying reason for this simplicity is that\nfeature-u is in charge of the setup and configuration of your\napplication.  Easy Peasy! I love it when a design comes\ntogether!!\nFeature Existence and Dependencies\nWhen a feature is completely self-contained (i.e. it has NO\nfassets definition), then there are no other\nconsideration in disabling it ... you simply disable it and it\ndisappears!\nIf however one feature depends on another (i.e. it has\nfassets definition), then there are additional\nfactors to consider.\nAs you know, the Fassets object is used to facilitate\nCross Feature Communication.  You can also use it to determine whether a\nfeature is present ... through it's Fassets.hasFeature()\nmethod.\n\nIt could be that featureA will conditionally use featureB if it\nis present.\nif (fassets.hasFeature('featureB') {\n  ... do something featureB related\n}\n\n\nIt could be that featureC unconditionally requires that featureD\nbe present.  This can be checked in the appWillStart()\nApplication Life Cycle Hook.\nappWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n  assert(fassets.hasFeature('featureD'), '***ERROR*** I NEED featureD');\n}\n\n\n\nNote: As an alternative to using Fassets.hasFeature(),\nyou can simply reason over the existence of \"well-known fasset\nresources\" specific to a given feature.\n"},"bestPractices.html":{"url":"bestPractices.html","title":"Best Practices","keywords":"","body":"Best Practices\nThis section will highlight some feature-based best practices,\nincluding some single-source-of-truth principles.\nEach of your feature implementations should strive to follow the\nsingle-source-of-truth principle.  In doing this, a single line\nmodification can propagate to many areas of your implementation.\nThis discussion is a guideline.  It's up to you to implement these\nitems because feature-u is not in control of this.\nAvoid Cross Feature Imports\nA best practice is to treat each of your features as isolated\nimplementations.\nAs a result, a given feature should never directly import\nresources from other features.  This is tempting because typically the\ncode is right there!\nIf one feature requires resources from other features, simply use the\nCross Feature Communication mechanism provided by feature-u (exposing\na smaller cross section of the Feature's Public Face).\nThere are a number of reasons for this:\n\nYour features truly become plug-and-play!  This is probably\nthe most compelling argument, and has many ramifications.\n\nIt is more controlled. By formally declaring Public Interface\npoints, this facilitates collaboration between features (and even\na better understanding between developers).\n\nWhen a feature is disabled, it is dynamically removed from the\nmix.  In many cases, this dynamic is automatically reflected\n(for example, when it is pulled in through\nWildcards).  Even when it is not\nautomatic, there is a built-in mechanism by which your logic can\nreason about the existence of a feature\n(i.e. Fassets.hasFeature()).\n\nFeatures can be tested in isolation. Simplified or mock\ncomponents can easily be provided to \"stand in\" for any named fassets\nwithout any sophisticated mocking technique.\n\nUpgrading features can be developed on a separate track.  A\n\"new and improved\" feature can co-exist, providing it conforms to\nthe same Public Face of the original.  Then at build or\nrun-time, the upgraded feature can be \"swapped in\" in place of the\noriginal.  This facilitates A/B testing and provides a nice\nmigration path while keeping the original feature fully operational\n(i.e. it can easily be reverted if necessary).\n\n\nFeature Name\nThe featureName is a critical item that can be used throughout your\nfeature implementation to promote a consistent feature identity.\nA key aspect of the featureName is that feature-u guarantees it's\nuniqueness.  As a result, it can be used to qualify the identity of\nseveral feature aspects.  For example:\n\nprefix action types with featureName, guaranteeing their uniqueness app-wide\n(see: feature-redux docs)\n\nprefix logic module names with featureName, identifying where that module lives\n(see: feature-redux-logic docs)\n\ndepending on the context, the featureName can be used as the root of your feature state's shape\n(see: feature-redux docs)\n\n\nWhile Feature.name is part of the Feature object\n(emitted from createFeature(), there are race conditions\nwhere the Feature object will not be defined during\nin-line code expansion.\nAs a result, a best practice is to expose a featureName constant,\nthrough a featureName.js mini-meta module that is \"importable\" in\nall use-cases (i.e. a single-source-of-truth).\nsrc/features/foo/featureName.js\n/**\n * Expose our featureName through a mini-meta module that is\n * \"importable\" in all use-cases (a single-source-of-truth).\n */\nexport default 'foo';\n\nFeature State Location\nBecause feature-u relies on\nslicedReducer()\n(in the feature-redux package), a best practice is to use\nthe reducer's embellished selector to qualify your feature state root\nin all your selector definitions.

In other words, the\nAspectContent can either be the actual content itself\n(ex: reducer, logic modules, etc.), or a function that returns\nthe content.  The latter:\n\nsupports Cross Feature Communication (through fassets object\ninjection), and\nminimizes circular dependency issues (of ES6 modules).\n\nManaged Expansion Callbacks are used when a fully resolved\nFassets object is required during in-line code expansion.\nThey are merely functions that when invoked (under the control of\nfeature-u), are supplied the Fassets object and\nreturn the expanded AspectContent (ex: reducer, logic\nmodules, etc.).\nFor more information (with examples), please refer to\nManaged Code Expansion.\nThe expandWithFassetsCB() function should conform to the\nfollowing signature:\nAPI: expandWithFassetsCB(fassets): AspectContent\n\n  \n    \n      ParamTypeDescription\n    \n  \n  \n\n    expandWithFassetsCBexpandWithFassetsCBthe callback\nfunction that when invoked (by feature-u) expands/returns the\ndesired AspectContent.\n\n      \n\n\nReturns: expandWithFassetsCB - the supplied expandWithFassetsCB,\nmarked as a \"managed expansion callback\".  \n\n\n\n  launchApp(features, [aspects], registerRootAppElm, [showStatus]) ⇒ Fassets\nLaunch an application by assembling the supplied features, driving\nthe configuration of the frameworks in use (as orchestrated by the\nsupplied set of plugable Aspects).\nFor more information (with examples), please refer to\nLaunching Your Application.\nPlease Note this function uses named parameters.\n\n  \n    \n      ParamTypeDescription\n    \n  \n  \n\n    featuresArray.the features that comprise this\napplication.\n\n    \n    [aspects]Array.the set of plugable Aspects that extend\nfeature-u, integrating other frameworks to match your specific\nrun-time stack.\nWhen NO Aspects are supplied (an atypical case), only the very\nbasic feature-u characteristics are in effect (like fassets\nand life-cycle hooks).\n\n    \n    registerRootAppElmregisterRootAppElmCBthe callback hook\nthat registers the supplied root application element to the specific\nReact framework used in the app.\nBecause this registration is accomplished by app-specific code,\nfeature-u can operate in any of the react platforms, such as:\nreact web, react-native,\nexpo, etc.\nPlease refer to React Registration for more\ndetails and complete examples.\n\n    \n    [showStatus]showStatusCBan optional callback hook that\ncommunicates a blocking \"persistent\" status message to the end\nuser.\nPlease refer to showStatus() for more information.\n\n      \n\n\nReturns: Fassets - the Fassets object used in \ncross-feature-communication.  \n\n\n\n  useFassets(p) ⇒ Fassets | fassets-resource | fassetsProps\nA React Hook that provides functional component access\nto feature-u fassets.\nHooks allow you to \"hook into\" React state and lifecycle\naspects from functional components.  They greatly simplify the UI\nimplementation as opposed to the alternative of Higher Order\nComponents (see: withFassets()).\nThere are three ways to invoke useFassets() (examples can be\nfound at UI Composition):\n\nPassing NO parameters, returns the\nFassets object:\n+ useFassets(): fassets\n\n\nPassing a fassetsKey (a string), returns the resolved\nfassets resource:\n+ useFassets('MainPage.*.link@withKeys'): [] ... an array of cataloged links\n\nThe fassetsKey parameter is identical (in usage) to the\nFassets.get() method.\n\nPassing a mapFassetsToPropsStruct, returns a set of\nresolved fassetsProps:\n+ useFassets({\n    mainBodies: 'MainPage.*.body',\n    mainLinks:  'MainPage.*.link@withKeys'\n  }): {  // ... return structure:\n    mainBodies: ... resolved cataloged resource\n    mainLinks:  ... ditto\n  }\n\nThe mapFassetsToPropsStruct allows you to return\nmore than one resolved fassets resources.\n\n\nSideBar: For useFassets() to operate,\n must be rendered at the root of your\napplication DOM.

Please refer to the\nmapFassetsToPropsStruct for the details of what this\nmapping construct looks like. Examples can be found at\nUI Composition.\nCentral to this process, a Higher-order Function (HoF) is created\nthat encapsulates this \"mapping knowledge\".  Ultimately, this\nHoF must be invoked (passing component), which exposes the HoC\n(the \"wrapped\" Component).\n+ withFassetsHoF(component): HoC\n\nThere are two ways to use withFassets():\n\nBy directly passing the component parameter, the HoC will be\nreturned (internally invoking the HoF).  This is the most\ncommon use case.\n\nBy omitting the component parameter, the HoF will be\nreturned.  This is useful to facilitate \"functional composition\"\n(in functional programming).  In this case it is the client's\nresponsibility to invoke the HoF (either directly or\nindirectly) in order to expose the HoC.\n\n\nSideBar: For withFassets() to operate,\n must be rendered at the root of your\napplication DOM.

It facilitates Cross Feature Communication by promoting\nthe public resources of any given feature.\nSideBar: The term fassets is a play on words.  While it is\npronounced \"facet\" and is loosely related to this term, it is\nspelled fassets (i.e. feature assets).\nThere are 3 different ways to reference the resources contained\nin the fassets object:\n\nYou may directly dereference them. As an example, an\n'action.openView' resource can be dereferenced as follows:\nfassets.action.openView('mainView');\n\n\nYou may use the Fassets.get() method, which\ncan collect multiple resources (using Wildcards).\n\nYour UI components may indirectly access fassets resources\nthrough the withFassets() Higher-order Component\n(HoC).\n\n\nSideBar: There are several ways to get a handle to the\nfassets object (see\nObtaining fassets object).\nFor more information, please refer to Cross Feature Communication and\nBasic Concepts: fassets.\n\nFassets : Object\n.get(fassetsKey) ⇒ resource | Array.\n.hasFeature(featureName) ⇒ boolean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Fassets.get(fassetsKey) ⇒ resource | Array.\nGet (i.e. fetch) the resource(s) corresponding to the supplied\nfassetsKey.\nThe fassets.get() method is an alternative to directly\ndereferencing the fassets object ... the advantage being:\n\nit can accumulate a series of resources (when\nWildcards are used)\n\nand it can more gracefully return undefined at any level\nwithin the federated namespace path\n\n\nRegarding the fassetsKey:\n\nIt is case-sensitive (as are the defined resources).\n\nIt may contain Wildcards (*), resulting in a\nmultiple resources being returned (a resource array), matching the\nsupplied pattern\n\nMatches are restricted to the actual fassetKeys registered through\nthe fassets aspect define/defineUse directives.  In\nother words, the matching algorithm will not drill into the\nresource itself (assuming it is an object with depth).\n\nThe special dot keyword ('.') will return the fassets\nobject itself (in the same tradition as \"current directory\").\n\n'@withKeys':\nIn some cases, you may wish to know the corresponding\nfassetsKey of the returned resource.  This is especially true\nwhen multiple resources are returned (using wildcards).  As\nan example, JSX requires unique keys for array injections (the\nfassetsKey is a prime candidate for this, since it is\nguaranteed to be unique).\nTo accomplish this, simply suffix the fassetsKey with the\nkeyword: '@withKeys'.  When this is encountered, the\nresource returned is a two-element array: [fassetsKey,\nresource].  SideBar: We use this suffix technique (as\nopposed to an additional parameter) to be consistent with how\nwithFassets() operates.\n\n\nSideBar: The fassets.get() method is the basis of both the\nuseFassets() React Hook, and the\nwithFassets() Higher-order Component (HoC).\n\n  \n    \n      ParamTypeDescription\n    \n  \n  \n\n    fassetsKeystringthe key of the resource(s) to fetch.\nThis may include wildcards (*), as well as the '@withKeys'\nsuffix (see discussion above).\n\n      \n\n\nReturns: resource | Array. - the requested fassets resource(s).\n\nwithout wildcards, a single resource is returned\n(undefined for none).\n'a.b.c':          abcResource\n'a.b.c@withKeys': ['a.b.c', abcResource]\n\n\nwith wildcards, the return is a resource array, in order\nof feature expansion (empty array for none).\n'a.*':          [ab1Resource, ab2Resource, ...]\n'a.*@withKeys': [ ['a.b1', ab1Resource], ['a.b2', ab2Resource], ... ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Fassets.hasFeature(featureName) ⇒ boolean\nReturn an indicator as to whether the supplied feature is\nactive or not.\nNote: As an alternative to using this method, you can\nconditionally reason over the existence of \"well-known fasset\nresources\" specific to a given feature.\n\n  \n    \n      ParamTypeDescription\n    \n  \n  \n\n    featureNamestringthe name of the feature to check.\n\n      \n\n\nReturns: boolean - true: is active, false: is not active\n(or doesn't exist).  \n\n\n\n  Feature : Object\nThe Feature object is merely a lightweight container that holds\nAspectContent of interest to feature-u.\nEach feature within an application promotes a Feature object (using\ncreateFeature()) which catalogs the aspects of that feature.\nUltimately, all Feature objects are consumed by\nlaunchApp().\nFeature content are simple key/value pairs (the key being an\nAspect.name with values of AspectContent).  These aspects can\neither be built-in (from core feature-u), or extensions.\nHere is an example:\nexport default createFeature({\n  name:     'featureA', // builtin aspect (name must be unique across all features within app)\n  enabled:  true,       // builtin aspect enabling/disabling feature\n\n  fassets: {            // builtin aspect promoting Public Face - Cross Feature Communication\n    define: {\n      'api.openA':  () => ...,\n      'api.closeA': () => ...,\n    },\n  },\n\n  appWillStart: (...) => ..., // builtin aspect (Application Life Cycle Hook)\n  appInit:      (...) => ..., // ditto\n  appDidStart:  (...) => ..., // ditto\n\n  reducer: ..., // feature redux reducer (extended aspect from the feature-redux plugin)\n  logic:   ..., // feature logic modules (extended aspect from the feature-redux-logic plugin)\n});\n\nFor more information, please refer to\nFeature & aspect content.\n\n\n\n  appWillStartCB ⇒ reactElm | void\nAn optional Application Life Cycle Hook invoked one time, very\nearly in the app startup process.\nThis life-cycle hook can do any type of general app-specific\ninitialization (for example initializing a PWA service\nworker).\nIn addition, it can optionally inject static content in the app's\nDOM root.  Any return is interpreted as the app's new rootAppElm\n(an accumulative process).  IMPORTANT: When this is used, the\nsupplied curRootAppElm MUST be included as part of this\ndefinition (accommodating the accumulative process of other feature\ninjections)! More information is available at\nInjecting DOM Content\nFor more information (with examples), please refer to the\nGuide's appWillStart.\nPlease Note this function uses named parameters.\n\n  \n    \n      ParamTypeDescription\n    \n  \n  \n\n    fassetsFassetsthe Fassets object used in cross-feature-communication.\n\n    \n    curRootAppElmreactElmthe current react app element\nroot.\n\n      \n\n\nReturns: reactElm | void - optionally, new top-level content (which in turn\nmust contain the supplied curRootAppElm).  Use a void return\nwhen top-level content is unchanged.  \n\n\n\n  appInitCB ⇒ Promise | void\nAn optional Application Life Cycle Hook invoked one time, later in\nthe app startup process.  It supports blocking async\ninitialization.\nThis hook is invoked when the app is nearly up-and-running.\n\nThe React Registration has already occurred\n(via the registerRootAppElm() callback).  As a\nresult, you can rely on utilities that require an app-specific\nrootAppElm to exist.\n\nYou have access to the appState and dispatch() function,\nassuming you are using redux (when detected by\nfeature-u's plugable aspects).\n\n\nJust like the appWillStart() hook, you may perform any\ntype of general initialization that is required by your feature.\nHowever the hallmark of this hook is you can block for any\nasynchronous initialization to complete.  By simply returning a\npromise, feature-u will wait for the process to complete.\nThe user is kept advised of any long-running async processes.  By\ndefault an 'initializing feature: {feature.name}' message is\nused, but you can customize it through the supplied\nshowStatus() function parameter.\nFor more info with examples, please see the Guide's\nappInit.\nPlease Note this function uses named parameters.\n\n  \n    \n      ParamTypeDescription\n    \n  \n  \n\n    showStatusshowStatusCBthe function that (when invoked)\nwill communicate a blocking \"persistent\" status message to the end\nuser.\n\n    \n    fassetsFassetsthe Fassets object used in cross-feature-communication.\n\n    \n    [appState]Anythe redux top-level app state (when redux\nis in use).\n\n    \n    [dispatch]functionthe redux dispatch() function (when\nredux is in use).\n\n      \n\n\nReturns: Promise | void - optionally, a promise (for asynchronous\nprocesses) - and feature-u will wait for the process to complete.\nUse a void return (for synchronous processes) - and no blocking\nwill occur.  \n\n\n\n  appDidStartCB ⇒\nAn optional Application Life Cycle Hook invoked one time,\nonce the app startup process has completed.\nThis life-cycle hook can be used to trigger \"the app is\nrunning\" events.  A typical usage is to \"kick start\" some\nearly application logic.\nBecause the app is up-and-running at this time, you have access to\nthe appState and dispatch() function ... assuming you are using\nredux (when detected by feature-u's plugable aspects).\nFor more info with examples, please see the Guide's\nappDidStart.\nPlease Note this function uses named parameters.\n\n  \n    \n      ParamTypeDescription\n    \n  \n  \n\n    fassetsFassetsthe Fassets object used in cross-feature-communication.\n\n    \n    [appState]Anythe redux top-level app state (when redux\nis in use).\n\n    \n    [dispatch]functionthe redux dispatch() function (when\nredux is in use).\n\n      \n\n\nReturns: void  \n\n\n\n  fassets : BuiltInAspect\nA builtin aspect that publicly promotes feature-based resources\ncalled fassets (feature assets).  These resources are the basis\nof Cross Feature Communication. You can think of this as the Public Face\nof a feature.\nSideBar: The term fassets is a play on words.  While it is\npronounced \"facet\" and is loosely related to this term, it is\nspelled fassets (i.e. feature assets).\nFeature resources are accumulated across all features, and exposed\nthrough the Fassets object.  They can also be referenced\nvia the withFassets() HoC.\nThe fassets aspect can both define resources, and/or declare a\nresource contract (i.e. the intention to use a set of fasset\nresources).

By default (when NO showStatus parameter is\nsupplied, feature-u will simply console log these messages.\nA typical manifestation of this callback is to display a running\npersistent SplashScreen, seeded with the supplied message.

Please see UI Composition\nfor examples.\nThe injected Component properties will reference the fasset\nresource corresponding to the fassetsKey.\nEach fassetsKey is case-sensitive (as are the defined resources).\nMatches are restricted to the actual fassetKeys registered through\nthe fassets aspect define/defineUse directives.  In\nother words, the matching algorithm will not drill into the\nresource itself (assuming it is an object with depth).\nThe special dot keyword ('.') will yield the fassets object\nitself (in the same tradition as \"current directory\").  This is\nuseful if you wish to inject fassets into downstream processes\n(such as redux connect() via it's ownProps).\nWildcards\nWildcards (*) are supported in the\nfassetsKey, accumulating multiple resources (a resource array),\nmatching the supplied pattern:\n\nwithout wildcards, a single resource is injected\n(undefined for none).\n\nwith wildcards, a resource array is injected, in order of\nfeature expansion (empty array for none).\n\n\nExample ...\nmapFassetsToProps: {\n  Logo:       'company.logo',\n              // Logo:  companyLogoResource,\n\n              // NOTE: wildcard usage ...\n  mainLinks:  'MainPage.*.link',\n              // mainLinks:  [cartLinkResource, searchLinkResource],\n  mainBodies: 'MainPage.*.body'\n              // mainBodies: [cartBodyResource, searchBodyResource],\n}\n\n@withKeys\nIn some cases, you may wish to know the corresponding\nfassetsKey of the returned resource.  This is especially true\nwhen multiple resources are returned (using wildcards).\nAs an example, React requires a key attribute for array\ninjections (the fassetsKey is a prime candidate for this, since\nit is guaranteed to be unique).\nTo accomplish this, simply suffix the fassetsKey with the\nkeyword: '@withKeys'.  When this is encountered, the resource\nreturned is a two-element array: [fassetsKey, resource].\nExample ...\nmapFassetsToProps: {\n  Logo:       'company.logo',\n              // Logo:  companyLogoResource,\n\n  mainLinks:  'MainPage.*.link@withKeys', // NOTE: @withKeys directive\n              // mainLinks:  [['MainPage.cart.link',   cartLinkResource],\n              //              ['MainPage.search.link', searchLinkResource]],\n  mainBodies: 'MainPage.*.body'\n              // mainBodies: [cartBodyResource, searchBodyResource],\n}\n\nThis topic is discussed in more detail in: React Keys (in array processing).\n\n\n\n  mapFassetsToPropsFn ⇒ mapFassetsToPropsStruct\nA function (used by withFassets()) that returns a\nmapFassetsToPropsStruct, defining a prop/fassetsKey\nmapping, from which fasset resources are injected into a Component.\n\n  \n    \n      ParamTypeDescription\n    \n  \n  \n\n    ownPropsobjthe outlying properties supplied to the\nconnected component.\n\n      \n\n\nReturns: mapFassetsToPropsStruct - the structure defining a\nprop/fassetsKey mapping, from which fasset resources are injected\ninto a Component.  \n\n\n\n  Aspect : Object\nAspect objects (emitted from createAspect()) are used to\nextend feature-u.\nThe Aspect object promotes a series of life-cycle methods that\nfeature-u invokes in a controlled way.  This life-cycle is\ncontrolled by launchApp() ... it is supplied the\nAspects, and it invokes their methods.\nTypically Aspects are packaged separately (as an external npm\nfeature-u extension), although they can be created locally\nwithin a project (if needed).\nFor more information, please refer to\nExtendable aspects and\nExtending feature-u.\n\n\n\n  AspectContent : Any\nThe content (or payload) of an Aspect, specified\nwithin a Feature.\nThe content type is specific to the Aspect. For example, a redux\nAspect assembles reducers (via Feature.reducer), while a\nredux-logic Aspect gathers logic modules (via Feature.logic),\netc.\nAspectContent can either be defined from built-in aspects\n(via core feature-u), or extensions (from\nAspect).\nAn Aspect object extends feature-u by accumulating\ninformation of interest from Feature objects (indexed\nby the Aspect name).\nNote: Whenever AspectContent definitions require the \nFassets object at code expansion time, you can wrap the\ndefinition in a expandWithFassets() function.  In other\nwords, your aspect content can either be the actual content itself\n(ex: a reducer), or a function that returns the content.\nFor more information, please refer to\nFeature & aspect content.\n\n\n\n  genesisMeth ⇒ string\nAn optional Life Cycle Hook invoked one time, at the very beginning of\nthe app's start up process.\nThis hook can perform Aspect related initialization and\nvalidation:\n\ninitialization: this is where where proprietary Aspect/Feature\nAPIs should be registered (if any) - via\nextendAspectProperty() and\nextendFeatureProperty() (please see:\nAspect Cross Communication).\n\nvalidation: this is where an aspect can verify it's own required\nconfiguration (if any). Some aspects require certain settings (set\nby the application) in self for them to operate.\n\n\nAPI: genesis(): string\nReturns: string - an error message when self is in an invalid state\n(falsy when valid).  Because this validation occurs under the\ncontrol of launchApp(), any message is prefixed with:\n'launchApp() parameter violation: '.  \n\n\n\n  validateFeatureContentMeth ⇒ string\nA validation hook allowing this aspect to verify it's content on\nthe supplied feature.\nAPI: validateFeatureContent(feature): string\n\n  \n    \n      ParamTypeDescription\n    \n  \n  \n\n    featureFeaturethe feature to validate, which is known\nto contain this aspect.\n\n      \n\n\nReturns: string - an error message string when the supplied feature\ncontains invalid content for this aspect (falsy when valid).\nBecause this validation conceptually occurs under the control of\ncreateFeature(), any message is prefixed with:\n'createFeature() parameter violation: '.  \n\n\n\n  expandFeatureContentMeth ⇒ string\nExpand self's AspectContent in the supplied feature,\nreplacing that content (within the feature).  Once expansion is\ncomplete, feature-u will perform a delayed validation of the\nexpanded content.\nAPI: expandFeatureContent(fassets, feature): string\nThe default behavior simply implements the expansion algorithm\ndefined by expandWithFassets():\nfeature[this.name] = feature[this.name](fassets);\n\nThis default behavior rarely needs to change.  It however provides\na hook for aspects that need to transfer additional content from\nthe expansion function to the expanded content.  As an example, the\nreducer aspect must transfer the slice property from the\nexpansion function to the expanded reducer.\n\n  \n    \n      ParamTypeDescription\n    \n  \n  \n\n    fassetsFassetsthe Fassets object used in feature\ncross-communication.\n\n    \n    featureFeaturethe feature which is known to contain\nthis aspect and is in need of expansion (as defined by\nexpandWithFassets()).\n\n      \n\n\nReturns: string - an optional error message when the supplied\nfeature contains invalid content for this aspect (falsy when\nvalid).

It operates in an open plugable\narchitecture where Extendable Aspects integrate feature-u to other\nframeworks, matching your specific run-time stack.  This is good,\nbecause not everyone uses the same frameworks!\n\nYou want state management using redux?

You use them the same way\nyou always have.  feature-u merely provides a well defined\norganizational layer, where the frameworks are automatically\nsetup and configured by accumulating the necessary resources across all\nyour features.\nLocating Extensions\nTo locate the latest set of published feature-u extensions, simply\nsearch the npm registry using a 'feature-u' keyword.  All\npackages that extend feature-u should include this keyword in\ntheir package.\nDuring feature-u's initial release (3/2018), I published the three\nAspects mentioned above (matching my preferred stack), so at that\ntime there were three plugins.  Assuming feature-u gains momentum,\nthe hope is that other authors will contribute their work.\nIf you create your own extension and decide to publish it, don't\nforget to include the 'feature-u' keyword in your package, so\nothers can easily locate your extension.\nAspect Object (extending feature-u)\nTo extend feature-u, you merely define and promote an\nAspect object (using createAspect()).\nThe Aspect object promotes a series of life-cycle methods\nthat feature-u invokes in a controlled way.  This life-cycle is\ncontrolled by launchApp() ... it is supplied the Aspects,\nand it invokes their methods.\nThe essential characteristics of the Aspect life-cycle is\nto:\n\naccumulate AspectContent across all features\nperform the desired setup and configuration\nexpose the framework in some way (by injecting a component in the\nroot DOM, or some Aspect Cross Communication\nmechanism)\n\nFor complete details, please refer to the section on\nAspect Life Cycle Methods.\nDefining rootAppElm\nIn feature-u the rootAppElm is the top-level react DOM that\nrepresents the display of the entire application.\nThis is a non-changing omnipresent DOM that achieves it's dynamics\nthrough a series of both framework components and application injected\nutilities.  As an example, a typical rootAppElm may contain:\n\na navigational component providing screen dynamics (through an Aspect Framework injection)\na state promotional component making state available to subordinates (through an Aspect Framework injection)\na notification utility (through an application Feature injection)\na left-nav menu (through an application Feature injection)\netc. etc. etc.\n\nThe rootAppElm is defined through a progressive accumulation of DOM\ninjections, using a combination of both Aspects and\nFeatures.\nThere are three API's involved and they all accept a curRootAppElm\nparameter, and return a new rootAppElm that includes the supplied\nelement, accommodating the accumulative process.\nThe three API's are listed here, and are executed in this order.\nThey include life-cycle-hooks that are defined from both\nAspects and Features.\n\nAspect.initialRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\nFeature.appWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}): rootAppElm | void\nAspect.injectRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\n\nIt is important to understand that the Feature hook is\nsandwiched between the two Aspect hooks.  Without this\ninsight, you would most certainly wonder what the difference was\nbetween the two Aspect hooks.\nA null rootAppElm seeds the entire process.  The first hook is used\nby any Aspect that wishes to inject itself before all others ... and\nso on.  The end result is a DOM hierarchy where the first injected\nelement is manifest at the bottom of the hierarchy, and the last\ninjection ends up on top.\nTo put this in perspective, let's analyze an example where we are\nusing two Aspects (feature-redux, and\nfeature-router), and an application Feature that manages a\nleft-nav menu available throughout the application.\n\nThe Aspect for feature-router (routeAspect) injects a\n component that (by design) can have no other\nchildren.  Therefore it uses the first api:\nrouteAspect: Aspect.initialRootAppElm()\nfunction initialRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm) {\n  // insure we don't clobber any supplied content\n  // ... by design,  doesn't support children\n  if (curRootAppElm) {\n    throw new Error('*** ERROR*** Please register routeAspect (from feature-router) before other Aspects ' +\n                    'that inject content in the rootAppElm ...  does NOT support children.');\n  }\n\n  // seed the rootAppElm with our StateRouter\n  return ;\n}\n\n\nThe leftNav application feature, injects it's Drawer/SideBar\ncomponent through the second API (the only one available to\nFeatures):\nleftNav: Feature.appWillStart()\nfunction appWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n  return (\n     registerDrawer(ref) }\n            content={}\n            onClose={closeSideBar}>\n      {curRootAppElm}\n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nThe Aspect for feature-redux (reducerAspect) injects the redux\n component that must encompass all other components\n(i.e. be on top). Therefore it uses the third API:\nreducerAspect: Aspect.injectRootAppElm()\nfunction injectRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm) {\n  return (\n    \n      {curRootAppElm}\n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nLast but not least, feature-u renders\n at the root of the application DOM (in\nsupport of Cross Feature Communication with the useFassets()\nHook and withFassets() HoC).\nThis is conditionally performed only when a rootAppElm has been\ndefined.  Otherwise, the App is responsible for this in the\nregisterRootAppElm() hook.\nif (rootAppElm) {\n  rootAppElm = {rootAppElm};\n}\n\n\n\nThe end result of this example generates the following DOM:\n\n  \n     registerDrawer(ref) }\n            content={}\n            onClose={closeSideBar}>\n      \n    \n  \n\nAspect Cross Communication\nSome Aspects will rely on an Aspect Cross Communication mechanism\nto accomplish their work (not to be confused with\nCross Feature Communication).\nAspect Cross Communication is where an Aspect requires\nadditional information (over and above it's\nAspectContent) either from other Aspects or\nFeatures.  Therefore the extending Aspect must define\n(and use) additional Aspect/Feature APIs.\nAs an example of this, consider the feature-redux plugin.\nBecause it manages redux, it also maintains the\nredux middleware.  As a result, it must provide a way for\nother Aspects to inject their middleware.  It accomplishes this by\nexposing a new Aspect API: Aspect.getReduxMiddleware().\n\nAn extending Aspect that introduces a new API should do the\nfollowing:\n\nDocument the API, so the external client knows how to use it.\n\nRegister the API, allowing it to pass feature-u validation.\nDepending on whether this is an API for a Aspect or\nFeature, use one of the following:\n\nAPI: extendAspectProperty(name, owner): void\nAPI: extendFeatureProperty(name, owner): void\n\nThis registration allows the new API (i.e. the name parameter)\nto be referenced in either createAspect() or\ncreateFeature() respectively.\nThis registration should occur in the Aspect.genesis()\nlife cycle method (i.e. very early) to guarantee the new API is\navailable during feature-u validation.\nSideBar: feature-u keeps track of the agent that owns\neach extension through the owner parameter.  Use any string that\nuniquely identifies your utility (such as the aspect's npm\npackage name).  This prevents exceptions when duplicate\nextension requests are made by the same owner.  This can happen\nwhen multiple instances of an aspect type are supported, and also\nin unit testing.\n\nUtilize the API in one of the\nAspect Life Cycle Methods to gather the\nadditional information (from other Aspects or\nFeatures).\n\n\n\nExample: \nAs a concrete example of this, let's look at some code snippets\nfrom the aforementioned feature-redux plugin:\n\nHere is how the new API is documented:\nfeature-redux#inputs\n\nMiddleware Integration:\nBecause feature-redux manages redux, other Aspects\ncan promote their redux middleware through\nfeature-redux's Aspect.getReduxMiddleware() API (an\nAspect Cross Communication mechanism).  As\nan example, the feature-redux-logic Aspect integrates\nredux-logic.\n\n\n\nHere is the new API registration:\nfeature-redux/src/reducerAspect.js\n/**\n * Register feature-redux proprietary Aspect APIs (required to pass\n * feature-u validation).\n * This must occur early in the life-cycle (i.e. this method) to\n * guarantee the new API is available during feature-u validation.\n */\nfunction genesis() {\n  extendAspectProperty('getReduxStore', 'feature-redux');      // Aspect.getReduxStore(): store\n  extendAspectProperty('getReduxMiddleware', 'feature-redux'); // Aspect.getReduxMiddleware(): reduxMiddleware\n}\n\n\nHere is the new API usage:\nfeature-redux-logic/src/logicAspect.js\n/**\n * Expose our redux middleware that activates redux-logic.  \n *\n * This method is consumed by the feature-redux Aspect using an\n * \"aspect cross-communication\".\n *\n * @private\n */\nfunction getReduxMiddleware() {\n  return this.logicMiddleware;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect Life Cycle Methods\nThe following list represents a complete compilation of all Aspect\nLife Cycle Methods.  Simply follow the link for a thorough\ndiscussion of each:\n\nAspect.name\nAspect.genesis(): string\nAspect.validateFeatureContent(feature): string\nAspect.expandFeatureContent(fassets, feature): string\nAspect.assembleFeatureContent(fassets, activeFeatures): void\nAspect.assembleAspectResources(fassets, aspects): void\nAspect.initialRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\nAspect.injectRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\nAspect.config\nAspect.additionalMethods()\n\nNotes of Interest ...\n\nExecution Order: \nThe order in which these methods are presented (above) represent\nthe same order they are executed.\n\n\n\nAspect State Retention: \nIt is common for an Aspect to use more than one of these\nlife cycle methods to do it's work.  When this happens, typically\nthere is a need for state retention (in order to pick up in one\nstep where it left off in another).\nAs an example, an Aspect may:\n\nuse Aspect.assembleFeatureContent() to assemble it's\ncontent across all features ... retaining the content\n\nand then use Aspect.injectRootAppElm() to promote the\ncontent assembled in the prior step\n\n\nThis state retention can be implemented in a number of different\nways, depending on your philosophy and run-time environment.  For\nexample, you could use the module context of an ES6 environment, or\nalternatively the Aspect object instance itself.\nThe latter is available (should you choose to use it) because\nthese hooks are in fact methods of the Aspect object.  In other\nwords, this is bound to the Aspect object instance.  As a\nresult, you are free to use this for your state retention.\n\n\n\nfassets Parameter:\nYou will notice that the fassets parameter is supplied on many of these\nlife cycle methods.  As you know the Fassets object is used\nin promoting Cross Feature Communication.  \nWhile it is most likely an anti-pattern to directly interrogate the\nFassets object within the Aspect, it is frequently required to\n\"pass through\" to downstream processes (as an opaque object).\nThis is the reason the fassets object is supplied!!\nAs examples of this:\n\nThe Feature.logic aspect (feature-redux-logic) will\ndependency inject (DI) the Fassets object into the\nredux-logic process.\n\nThe Feature.route aspect (feature-router)\ncommunicates fassets in it's routing callbacks.\n\netc. etc. etc.\n\n\n\n\nAspect.name\nThe Aspect.name is used to \"key\" AspectContent of this\ntype in the Feature object.  \nFor example: an Aspect.name: 'xyz' would permit a Feature.xyz:\nxyzContent construct.\nAs a result, Aspect names cannot clash with built-in aspects, and\nthey must be unique (across all aspects that are in-use).\nBest Practice ...\nIt is a good practice to allow your Aspect name to be re-configured at\nrun-time because they must be unique, and externally published\nAspects cannot know the Aspect mix that is in-use.  This can be\naccomplished through a defensive Aspect implementation that references\nfeature properties by indexing the Aspect.name rather than hard coding\nit.\nAs an example, the following code snippet assumes a context of an xyz\nAspect method ...\nxyzAspect.someMethod():\n  ...\n  const feature = ...;\n\n  // DO NOT HARD CODE:\n  ... feature.xyz\n\n  // RATHER INDEX:\n  ... feature[this.name]\n\nThis allows your clientele to reset the Aspect.name as follows:\nclient code initialization:\n  xyzAspect.name = 'xyzFoo';\n\nAspect.genesis()\nAPI: genesis(): string\ngenesis() is an optional Life Cycle Hook invoked one\ntime, at the very beginning of the app's start up process.\nThis hook can perform Aspect related initialization and\nvalidation:\n\ninitialization: this is where where proprietary Aspect/Feature\nAPIs should be registered (if any) - via\nextendAspectProperty() and\nextendFeatureProperty() (please see:\nAspect Cross Communication).\n\nvalidation: this is where an aspect can verify it's own required\nconfiguration (if any). Some aspects require certain settings (set\nby the application) in self for them to operate.\n\n\nRETURN: an error message string when self is in an invalid state\n(falsy when valid).  Because this validation occurs under the control\nof launchApp(), any message is prefixed with: 'launchApp() parameter\nviolation: '.\nAspect.validateFeatureContent()\nAPI: validateFeatureContent(feature): string\nvalidateFeatureContent() is a validation hook allowing\nthis aspect to verify it's content on the supplied feature (which is\nknown to contain this aspect).\nRETURN: an error message string when the supplied feature contains\ninvalid content for this aspect (falsy when valid).  Because this\nvalidation conceptually occurs under the control of\ncreateFeature(), any message is prefixed with:\n'createFeature() parameter violation: '.\nAspect.expandFeatureContent()\nAPI: expandFeatureContent(fassets, feature): string\nexpandFeatureContent() is an optional aspect expansion\nhook, defaulting to the algorithm defined by expandWithFassets().\nThis method (when used) should expand self's\nAspectContent in the supplied feature (which is known to\ncontain this aspect and is in need of expansion), replacing that\ncontent (within the feature).\nOnce expansion is complete, feature-u will perform a delayed\nvalidation of the expanded content.\nThe default behavior simply implements the expansion algorithm\ndefined by expandWithFassets():\nfeature[this.name] = feature[this.name](fassets);\n\nThis default behavior rarely needs to change.  It however provides a\nhook for aspects that need to transfer additional content from the\nexpansion function to the expanded content.  As an example, the\nreducer aspect must transfer the slice property from the expansion\nfunction to the expanded reducer.\nRETURN: an optional error message string when the supplied feature\ncontains invalid content for this aspect (falsy when valid).  This is\na specialized validation of the expansion function, over-and-above\nwhat is checked in the standard validateFeatureContent() hook.\nAspect.assembleFeatureContent()\nAPI: assembleFeatureContent(fassets, activeFeatures): void\nassembleFeatureContent() assembles content for this\naspect across all features, retaining needed state for subsequent ops.\nThis method is required because this is the primary task that is\naccomplished by all aspects.\nAspect.assembleAspectResources()\nAPI: assembleAspectResources(fassets, aspects): void\nassembleAspectResources() is an optional hook that\nassembles resources for this aspect across all other aspects, retaining\nneeded state for subsequent ops.  This hook is executed after all the\naspects have assembled their feature content (i.e. after\nassembleFeatureContent()).\nThis is an optional second-pass (so-to-speak) of Aspect data\ngathering, that facilitates\nAspect Cross Communication.  It allows an\nextending aspect to gather resources from other aspects, using an\nadditional API (ex: Aspect.getXyz()).\nAs an example of this, consider feature-redux.  Because it\nmanages redux, it must promote a technique by which other\nAspects can register their redux middleware.  This is accomplished\nthrough the proprietary method: Aspect.getReduxMiddleware():\nmiddleware.\nAspect.initialRootAppElm()\nAPI: initialRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\ninitialRootAppElm() is an optional callback hook that\npromotes some characteristic of this aspect within the rootAppElm\n... the top-level react DOM that represents the display of the entire\napplication.\nThe Defining rootAppElm section highlights when to\nuse initialRootAppElm() verses\ninjectRootAppElm().\nNOTE: When this hook is used, the supplied curRootAppElm MUST be\nincluded as part of this definition!\nRETURN: a new react app element root (which in turn must contain\nthe supplied curRootAppElm), or simply the supplied curRootAppElm (if\nno change).\nAspect.injectRootAppElm()\nAPI: injectRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\ninjectRootAppElm() is an optional callback hook that\npromotes some characteristic of this aspect within the rootAppElm\n... the top-level react DOM that represents the display of the entire\napplication.\nThe Defining rootAppElm section highlights when to\nuse initialRootAppElm() verses\ninjectRootAppElm().\nNOTE: When this hook is used, the supplied curRootAppElm MUST be\nincluded as part of this definition!\nRETURN: a new react app element root (which in turn must contain\nthe supplied curRootAppElm), or simply the supplied curRootAppElm (if\nno change).\nAspect.config\nThe Aspect.config is a sub-object that can optionally be used for\nany type of configuration that a specific Aspect may\nneed.  Configurations (if any) should be documented by the specific\nAspect, and if required, should be validated in the\nAspect.genesis() hook.\nThe config sub-object is \"open\" in the sense that any content is\nallowed.  In other words there is no need to pre-register acceptable\nproperties on the config sub-object (as there is in direct properties\nof the Aspect object ... i.e. extendAspectProperty()).\nIn addition to configuration, it is common for Aspects to use the\nconfig sub-object for hidden diagnostic purposes (hidden in the\nsense that they are not documented).  These settings are employed\nwhen researching an issue, and typically alter behavior in some way or\nglean additional information.  As such they would only be communicated\nto users on a case-by-case basis.\nAspect.additionalMethods()\nAspects may contain additional \"proprietary\" methods in support of\nAspect Cross Communication ... a contract\nbetween one or more aspects.  This is merely an API specified by one\nAspect, and used by another Aspect,\nfacilitated through the assembleAspectResources(fassets, aspects): void\nhook.\nAs an example of this, consider feature-redux.  Because it\nmanages redux, it must promote a technique by which other\nAspects can register their redux middleware.  This is accomplished\nthrough the proprietary method: Aspect.getReduxMiddleware():\nmiddleware.\n"},"extensionApi.html":{"url":"extensionApi.html","title":"Extension API","keywords":"","body":"Extension API\nThe following list summarizes the Extension API.

How do you encapsulate your features while\npulling them back together so they operate as one application?\nThis list (below) provides some considerations that formed the basis\nof why feature-u was developed!\nI hope you enjoy this effort, and comments are always welcome.\n\nP.S. The feature-u library was pulled from a sandbox project\neatery-nod-w (a PWA) that I use to study\nseveral technologies and frameworks.\nP.P.S. If you are wondering what the \"-u\" stands for, it is merely a\nsuccinct suffix that distinguishes a number of my published\nutilities.\nAs promised, here is the list ...\n\nFeature Encapsulation:\nMost characteristics of a feature strive to be self-sufficient and\nindependent.  Where possible, they operate within their own\nisolated implementation.\nSolution: Various feature-u traits\n\nFeature Collaboration:\nEven though a feature's implementation is encapsulated, it still\nneeds to interact with it's surroundings.  There is a need for\ncollaboration between features.  This however should be accomplished\nthrough a well-defined feature-based public interface.\nSolution: Cross Feature Communication\n\nFeature Based UI Composition:\nComponent composition can easily cross feature boundaries.  There\nis a need to facilitate cross-feature content injection in a\nseamless (and potentially autonomous) way.\nSolution: UI Composition\n\nFeature Initialization:\nAny given feature should not have to rely on an external startup\nprocess to perform the initialization that it needs.  Rather, the\nfeature should be able to spawn initialization that it depends on.\nThis could be any number of things, such as:\n\ninitialize some service API\ninject a utility react component at the root of the App\ndispatch an action that kicks off some startup process\netc.\n\nSolution: Application Life Cycle Hook\n\nFeature Enablement:\nYou may have the need for selected features to be dynamically\nenabled or disabled.  As an example, certain features may only be\nenabled with a license upgrade, or other features may only be used for\ndiagnostic purposes.\nSolution: Feature Enablement\n\nResource Resolution during Code Expansion:\nThere are situations where resource access can be problematic. This\nis typically a timing issue, during in-line code expansion,\nwhere the resource is not fully defined YET.  This ultimately is\ndue to order dependencies across features.  \nHow can this problem be minimized?\nSolution: Managed Code Expansion\n\nFramework Integration:\nMost likely your application employs a number of different\nframeworks (ex: redux, redux-logic, etc.).\nAs a result, your features are typically going to rely on these\nsame frameworks.\nHow are the resources needed by these frameworks accumulated and\nconfigured across the many features of your app?\nSolution: Extendable aspects -and- Launching Your Application\n\nUI Component Promotion:\nFeatures that maintain their own UI components need a way to promote\nthem in the overall app's GUI.  How is this accomplished in an\nautonomous way?\nSolution: Feature Based Routes\n\nSingle Source of Truth:\nWhat are some Best Practices for \"Single Source of Truth\" as it\nrelates to features, and how can feature-u help?\nSolution: see: Best Practices\n\nSimplified App Startup:\nAfter breaking your application into pieces (i.e. features), how do\nyou pull it all together, and actually start your app running?\nAt first glance, this may seem like a daunting task.  As it\nturns out, however, because of the structure promoted by feature-u,\nit actually is a very simple process.\nSolution: Launching Your Application\n\nOperates in any React Platform:\nfeature-u is compatible with any of the React Platforms,\nincluding: react-web react-native\nexpo.\nSolution: React Registration\n\nPlug-and-Play:\nThis is probably the most important outcome of using feature-u.\nBy using the various constructs provided by feature-u, the mere\nexistence of a feature will automatically emit it's characteristics.\nIn other words, it plugs-and-plays!\nThis even extends a feature's \"logical existence\", where it can be\ndynamically disabled via Feature Enablement.\nFrom this perspective, you can think of each feature as it's own\nisolated mini application.\nSolution: All feature-u constructs :-)\n\n\n"},"history.html":{"url":"history.html","title":"Revision History","keywords":"","body":"Revision History\nThe feature-u project adheres to Semantic\nVersioning.

It represents a significant step\nforward in providing seamless feature-based development.\nSideBar: To give you some background, the V1 design progressed\nfrom a simple plugin to a full core offering:\n\nInitially, the focus was on a new navigation plugin that supported\nreact-router.\n\nWith react-router's V4 release, we realized our plugin could broaden\nit's scope to overall UI Composition - because that is how RR V4\nworks.\n\nAs a further progression, we realized that\nUI Composition was simply one part of the\noverall Cross Feature Communication.  By incorporating this into a core\nfeature-u offering, all cross-communication could use the same\nmechanism.\nIn addition, this seemed like a good time to to standardize some\nambiguous terms from our initial cross-communication attempt.\n\n\nfeature-u migration\n\nThe return of launchApp() is now the\nFassets object.  Per the recomendation to export this,\nplease note that this is no longer the app object, rather the\nFassets object.\n\nAny feature-u API that was passing the app object as a\nparameter, is NOW the Fassets object.\nDepending on your IDE and dev environment, this can be a tedious\nproces to retrofit.  If you are using some type of search, the\n\"app\" nominclature is going to appear in many different contexts.\n\nEither work through your code base, one by one (searching for app\nparameters/variables)\n\nOr focus on the various APIs summarized in the Core API\n(focusing on the signatures with fassets parameters).\nIf you are retrofitting an Aspect plugin, do the same thing with\nthe Extension API.\n\n\n\nAny Feature.publicFace aspect must be converted to the new\nFeature.fassets aspect.\nWhile it is possible to translate a one-to-one mapping (between the\nold publicFace and the new fassets aspect) you are encourged to\nemploy the new enhancments of Cross Feature Communication, such as:\n\nFull UI Composition via the\nwithFassets() HoC.\n\nResource Contracts, via the fassets.use\nand fassets.defineUse directives.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, refactor out the featureName\nresource qualifier.\n\n\nHere is an example that translates publicFace to fassets with\nan equivilant mapping:\n\n\n   OLD publicFace\n   publicFace: { // OBSOLETE in feature-u V1\n     api,\n     sel: {\n       areFontsLoaded,\n       isDeviceReady,\n       getDeviceLoc,\n     },\n     actions: {\n       ready: actions.ready,\n     },\n   },\n\n    \n   NEW fassets.define equivalent\n   fassets: { // NEW feature-u V1\n     define: {\n       [`${featureName}.api`]:                api,\n\n       [`${featureName}.sel.areFontsLoaded`]: areFontsLoaded,\n       [`${featureName}.sel.isDeviceReady`]:  isDeviceReady,\n       [`${featureName}.sel.getDeviceLoc`]:   getDeviceLoc,\n\n       [`${featureName}.actions.ready`]:      actions.ready,\n     },\n   },\n\nfeature-redux migration\nIf you are using the feature-redux plugin, you must\ninstall the latest version.\n\nThis plugin has eliminated singletons in favor of creators (to\nfacilitate testing and server-side rendering).\n // in place of this:\n import {reducerAspect}   from 'feature-redux';\n\n // do this:\n import {createReducerAspect} from 'feature-redux';\n const reducerAspect = createReducerAspect();\n\n\n\nfeature-redux-logic migration\nIf you are using the feature-redux-logic plugin, you must\ninstall the latest version.\n\nBecause feature-redux-logic auto injects the\nFassets object as a dependency in your logic modules\n(promoting full Cross Feature Communication, the logic modules in your\napplication code must reflect this change by renaming this named\nparameter from app to fassets, and utilize the new fassets API\naccordingly.\n\nThis plugin has eliminated singletons in favor of creators (to\nfacilitate testing and server-side rendering).\n // in place of this:\n import {logicAspect}   from 'feature-redux-logic';\n\n // do this:\n import {createLogicAspect} from 'feature-redux-logic';\n const logicAspect = createLogicAspect();\n\n\n\nfeature-router migration\nIf you are using the feature-router plugin, you must\ninstall the latest version.\n\nBecause feature-router auto injects the\nFassets object as a dependency in your routes (promoting\nfull Cross Feature Communication), the routes in your application code\nmust reflect this change by renaming this named parameter from app\nto fassets, and utilize the new fassets API accordingly.\n\nThis plugin has eliminated singletons in favor of creators (to\nfacilitate testing and server-side rendering).\n // in place of this:\n import {routeAspect}   from 'feature-router';\n\n // do this:\n import {createRouteAspect} from 'feature-router';\n const routeAspect = createRouteAspect();\n\n\n\n \n"},"LICENSE.html":{"url":"LICENSE.html","title":"MIT License","keywords":"","body":"MIT License\nCopyright (c) 2018 Kevin Bridges\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
