## Versioned Docs

**feature-u** maintains version-specific documentation for all of it's
releases _(linked below)_ ... ex: https://feature-u.js.org/0.1.0/.
This allows you to match the correct documentation to the specific
version you are using.
For your convenience the base https://feature-u.js.org/ will always
reference the most current release.

* PROCEDURE for maintaining LINKS in history.md
*-----------------------------------------------

1. for latest running work-in-progress: it is OK to use the gitbook templates
   - EX:       bla bla {{book.api.createFeature}}
   - template: bla bla [`createFeature()`](/api.md#createFeature)
   - gens:     bla bla <a href="api.html#createFeature"><code>createFeature()</code></a>
   - NOTES:
     a) clicking link STAYS ON SAME PAGE (as for all links of this type)
 
2. for RELEASE: expand them in-line using a VERSION RELATIVE SYNTAX -AND- change .md to .html:
   - EX:       bla bla [`createFeature()`](../v.v.v/api.html#createFeature)
               NOTES:
                - start with template definition
                - pre-pend ../v.v.v/
                - change .md to .html (BECAUSE WE ARE TAKING the generation process out-of-the-picture)
   - gens:     bla bla <a href="../v.v.v/api.html#createFeature"><code>createFeature()</code></a>
   - NOTES:
     a) clicking link STAYS ON SAME PAGE
     b) because these notes are copied to all release history.md, 
        they MUST reference the appropriate version
        so they will be guaranteed the reference has not been removed/changed
 
3. for GITHUB release page (when copying these notes), fully qualify the VERSIONED relative references
   - EX:       bla bla [`createFeature()`](https://feature-u.js.org/v.v.v/api.html#createFeature)
               NOTES:
                - from prior rendition
                - REPLACE ../v.v.v WITH https://feature-u.js.org/v.v.v
                - change .md TO .html
   - NOTES:
     a) this allows it to stand alone (in the external github page)
     b) because these notes reference a versioned site
        they will be guaranteed the reference has not been removed/changed

<h3 id="v1_0_1" style="margin: 10px 0px; border-width: 5px 0px; padding: 5px; border-style: solid;">
  v1.0.1 - Docs Update <i>(September 5, 2018)</i>
</h3>

[Full Docs](https://feature-u.js.org/1.0.1/)
&bull;
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-u/releases/tag/v1.0.1)
&bull;
[GitHub Content](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-u/tree/v1.0.1)
&bull;
[Diff](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-u/compare/v1.0.0-docs...v1.0.1)

**NOTE**: This release is a **non-breaking change** _(i.e. no API was affected)_.

1. **Docs**: Documentation improvements include:

   - The {{book.guide.basicConcepts}} chapter has been completely re-written
     to fully introduce you to **all feature-u concepts and terminology**.

     Diagrams are used to put everything in perspective _("with
     circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one
     explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us"
     ... Arlo Guthrie â€“ [Alice's
     Restaurant](https://www.letras.com/guthrie-arlo/17170/))_.

     This is a **must read** to get you "up to speed" quickly!

   - Diagrams are now styled to be visiable in all themes _(including
     dark mode)_.

   - All code samples utilize a feature.js module _(previously
     index.js)_.

   - The `src/app.js` sample (found in
     {{book.guide.detail_launchingApp}}), has been streamlined.

2. **Added**: A new {{book.api.assertNoRootAppElm}} convenience function
   has been added _(see: {{book.guide.injectingDomContent}})_.

[Migration Notes](https://feature-u.js.org/1.0.0/migration.1.0.0.html)

**NOTE**: This release contains **breaking changes** from prior
releases.  _A retrofit of client code is necessary (see the
**Migration Notes** link above)_.

1. **Review**: New **UI Composition**

   Beginning with **feature-u V1**
   [`Cross Feature Communication`](../1.0.0/crossCommunication.html)
   has been completely re-designed to include
   [`UI Composition`](../1.0.0/crossCommunication.html#ui-composition)
   as a core offering of **feature-u** _(thanks {{book.ext.jeffbski}} for
   the design collaboration)_!

   - This refactor promotes **one solution** for all 
     [`Cross Feature Communication`](../1.0.0/crossCommunication.html)
     _(i.e. Actions, Selectors, UI Components, API, etc.)_, **making it
     comprehensive and universal**.
     
   - This is an **extremely powerful enhancement**, and even extends to
     things like [`Feature Based Routes`](../1.0.0/featureRouter.html).
     
   - It **represents a significant step forward** in providing seamless
     feature-based development!

   At a high level, the following items have been impacted _(more
   detail can be found at [`Cross Feature Communication`](../1.0.0/crossCommunication.html))_:
   
   - In an effort to standardize terminology _(and remove ambiguity)_,
     the term `fassets` _(feature assets)_ is being used throughout,
     replacing `publicFace` _(on the aspect definition side)_ and `app`
     _(on the usage side)_.

   - The [`Feature.fassets`](../1.0.0/api.html#fassets) aspect replaces
     [`Feature.publicFace`](../0.1.3/crossCommunication.html#publicface-and-the-app-object),
     providing a more formal set of directives, supporting things like
     **contractual arrangements** _(of usage and definition)_, and
     **validation of resources**.

   - The [`fassets`](../1.0.0/api.html#Fassets) object replaces the
     [`app`](../0.1.3/api.html#App) object, to programmatically
     access cross-feature resources.

   - The [`managedExpansion()`](../0.1.3/api.html#managedExpansion)
     function has been renamed to
     [`expandWithFassets()`](../1.0.0/api.html#expandWithFassets).
   
   - The new [`withFassets()`](../1.0.0/api.html#withFassets)
     higher-order component (HOC) auto-wires named feature assets as
     component properties.

   In addition, if you are using any of the **feature-u** extended
   aspect plugins, you must install the latest version, as they now
   pass through the new [`fassets`](../1.0.0/api.html#Fassets) object.

2. **Docs**: Documentation improvements include:

   - The docs have been enhanced in several areas, including API
     clarifications, improved cross-navigation between API/Guide,
     additional points of interest, examples, etc.  Take a peek
     (always improving).

   - Several diagrams have been added to the docs.  You know what they
     say: "a picture is worth a thousand words"!

   - Our docs now employ a dynamic left-nav menu, that only exposes
     sub-sections of the active section.  As a result, we now promote
     more left-nav sub-section links, improving the visualization of
     "where you are at" in larger topics.

  v0.1.3 - Establish Polyfill Strategy <i>(July 2, 2018)</i>
</h3>

[Full Docs](https://feature-u.js.org/0.1.3/)
&bull;
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-u/releases/tag/v0.1.3)
&bull;

&bull;
[Diff](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-u/compare/v0.1.0-docs...v0.1.3)

**NOTE**: This release is a **non-breaking change** _(i.e. no API was affected)_.

1. **Review**: A new policy is in affect where **polyfills are the
   responsibility of the client app**, when the target JavaScript
   engine is inadequate _(such as the IE browser)_.  Please refer to
   [`Potential Need for Polyfills`](../0.1.3/start.html#potential-need-for-polyfills) for more information.
   
   As a result, all previous code patches related to es2015+ polyfill
   issues were removed, in favor of **polyfilling at the app-level**.
   
1. **Internal**: The most current babel version/configuration is now
   used to transpile the library's es5 distribution.

1. **Internal**: The most current docs version/configuration
   (i.e. GitBook, JSDoc) is now used to generate our documentation.
