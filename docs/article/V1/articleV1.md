# feature-u V1 (Feature Based Project Organization for React)

This article is an introduction to a new JS library called
**[feature-u]**, that **facilitates feature-based project organization
in your [react] project**.  It provides tangible assistance in promoting
individual **plug-and-play** features within your project.

<p align="center"><img src="../../img/featureUSplash.jpg"  alt="Features" width="80%"></p>

Most developers would agree that organizing your project by feature is
much preferred over type-based patterns. Because **application domains
grow** in the real world, project **organization by type simply
doesn't scale**, _it just becomes unmanageable_!

There are many good articles on this topic with insights on
feature-based design and structure _(see: [References] below
TK:medium-resolve-internal-link)_.  However when it comes to the
implementation, you are pretty much left to fend for yourself.

This article is an introduction to **feature-u**, building concepts and
insights.  It makes a case for why **feature-u** was developed and gives
you a better understanding of it's benefits.

Check out the [full docs], [github source], and [npm package].

**[feature-u]** opens new doors into the exciting world of
feature-based development.  It frees you up to **focus your attention
on the "business end" of your features!** _Go forth and compute!!_

---

**Note**: On 8/14/2018 [feature-u V1] was released, that re-designed
[Cross Feature Communication] to include [UI Composition] as a core
offering.  This article covers the V1 release.  _(the first article,
based on [feature-u V0], can be found
[here](http://bit.ly/feature-u))_.  We are very excited about this
update, because it **promotes one solution for all feature
collaboration**!
