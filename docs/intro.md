# feature-u

{{book.sym.featureDu}} is a utility library that _facilitates
feature-based project organization_ in your {{book.ext.react}}
project.  It assists in organizing your project by individual
features.  

Most software engineers would agree that organizing your project by
feature is much preferred over type-based patterns.  Because
application domains grow in the real world, project organization by
type simply doesn't scale, it just becomes unmanageable!  There are a
number of good articles that discuss this topic _(with insights on
feature-based design and structure)_.

{{book.sym.featureDu}} is a utility library that manages and
streamlines this process.  It automates some of the mundane details of
your features and helps in promoting features that are
**plug-and-play**.

{{book.sym.featureDu}} allows you to **focus your attention on the
"business end" of your features!**

_Go forth and compute!!_
