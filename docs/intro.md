# feature-u

**feature-u** is a utility library that _facilitates feature-based
project organization_ in your {{book.ext.react}} project.  It assists
in organizing your project by individual features.

Most software engineers would agree that organizing your project by
feature is much preferred over type-based patterns.  Because
application domains grow in the real world, project organization by
type simply doesn't scale, it just becomes unmanageable!  There are a
number of good articles that discuss this topic _(with insights on
feature-based design and structure)_.

**feature-u** is a utility library that manages and streamlines this
process.  It automates some of the mundane details of your features
and helps in promoting features that are **plug-and-play**.

**feature-u** allows you to **focus your attention on the "business
end" of your features!**

_Go forth and compute!!_
