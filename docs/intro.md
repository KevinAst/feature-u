# feature-u

**feature-u** is a utility library that _facilitates feature-based
development_ in your {{book.ext.react}} project.  It provides
tangible assistance in promoting individual **plug-and-play** features
within your project.

Most developers would agree that organizing your project by feature is
much preferred over type-based patterns.  Because **application
domains grow** in the real world, project **organization by type
simply doesn't scale**, _it just becomes unmanageable_!

There are a number of good articles that discuss this topic _with
insight on feature-based design and structure_.  However when it comes
to the implementation, you are pretty much left to fend for yourself.

**feature-u** is a utility library that manages and streamlines this
process.  It automates the mundane details of managing features
and helps to promote features that are truly **plug-and-play**.

You can quickly **"come up to speed"** with **feature-u** by reviewing
the {{book.guide.playfulFeaturesVideo}}, that builds concepts,
and demonstrates them in a real world app ({{book.ext.eateryNodW}}).

**feature-u** opens new doors into the exciting world of
feature-based development.  It frees you up to **focus your attention
on the "business end" of your features!**
