# Benefits

There are many benefits in using **feature-u**!

The two fundamental artifacts from which most benefits are derived
are:

- A formal means by which features can collaborate with one another
  _({{book.guide.crossCom}})_, making them truly **plug-and-play**

  - This includes the ability for
    {{book.guide.crossCom_uiComposition}} to cross feature
    boundaries.  It even allows UI Content to be injected
    autonomously.  This is something that has to be seen ... it shows
    off **feature-u** very well.


- A significant reduction in boilerplate code through:

  - Auto configuration of the frameworks in-use _(via plugin
    extensions - {{book.guide.detail_extendableAspects}})_

  - Startup initialization that is encapsulated within features
    _(via {{book.guide.appLifeCycles}})_

The following list of benefits can be directly correlated to the
considerations that formed the basis of why **feature-u** was
developed _(see: {{book.guide.why}})_.

1. **Feature Encapsulation:**
   _isolating feature boundaries improves code manageability_

1. **Feature Collaboration:**
   _promote **Cross Feature Communication** through a well-defined
   feature-based Public Interface_

1. **Feature Based UI Composition:**
   _facilitate seamless **cross-feature component composition**_

1. **Application Life Cycle Hooks:**
   _features can initialize themselves without relying on an external
   process_

1. **Feature Enablement:**
    _enable/disable features through a run-time switch_

1. **Minimize Feature Order Dependency Issues**
   _during in-line code expansion_

1. **Framework Integration:**
   _automatically configure used framework(s) (matching the app's
   run-time-stack) by accumulating all feature aspects (employing an
   extendable API)_

1. **UI Component Promotion:**
   _features can autonomously promote their UI components through
   Feature Based Route Management_

1. **Single Source of Truth:**
   _is facilitated in a number of ways within a feature's
   implementation_

1. **Simplified App Startup:**
   _launching an app can be accomplished through a single line of
   executable code!_

1. **Operates in any React Platform**
   _React Web, React Native, Expo, etc._

1. **Plug-and-Play:**
   _features can be more easily added or removed_


**feature-u** allows you to **focus your attention on the "business
end" of your features!**

_Go forth and compute!!_
