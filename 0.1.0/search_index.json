is a utility library that facilitates feature-based\nproject organization in your react project.  It assists\nin organizing your project by individual features.\nMost software engineers would agree that organizing your project by\nfeature is much preferred over type-based patterns.  Because\napplication domains grow in the real world, project organization by\ntype simply doesn't scale, it just becomes unmanageable!  There are a\nnumber of good articles that discuss this topic (with insights on\nfeature-based design and structure).\nfeature-u is a utility library that manages and streamlines this\nprocess.

You have decided to structure your project by features.\nFrom a design perspective, there are a number of considerations in\ndetermining the feature boundaries.  Your code has been separated into\nindividual feature directories, and in general, you are feeling good\nabout the progress.\nYour intuition is starting to realize concrete benefits ... feature\nsegregation is going to result in code that much more manageable!\nthe Hurdles ...\nHowever, there are a number of hurdles yet to be resolved ...\n\nHow do you encapsulate and isolate your features, while still\nallowing them to collaborate with one another?\n\nHow do selected features introduce start-up initialization (even\ninjecting utility at the root DOM), without relying on some\nexternal startup process?\n\nHow do you promote feature-based UI components in an isolated and\nautonomous way?\n\nHow do you configure your chosen frameworks now that your code is\nso spread out?\n\nHow do you enable/disable selected features which are either\noptional, or require a license upgrade?\n\nIn short, how do you pull it all together so that your individual\nfeatures operate as one application?\n\n\nwhat now? (the Goal) ...\nThe overriding goal of feature-u is two fold:\n\nAllow features to Plug-and-Play! This encompasses many things,\nsuch as: encapsulation, cross communication, enablement,\ninitialization, etc., etc.  We will build on these concepts\nthroughout this documentation.\n\nAutomate the startup of your application!! You have the\nfeatures.  Allow them to promote their characteristics, so a\ncentral utility can automatically configure the frameworks used\nin your app, thereby launching your application!\nThis task must be accomplished in an extendable way, because\nnot everyone uses the same set of frameworks!\n\n\nfeature-u Basics\nThe basic process of feature-u is that each feature promotes a\nFeature object that contains various aspects of that\nfeature ... things like: the feature's name, it's Public API, whether\nit is enabled, initialization constructs, and resources used to\nconfigure it's slice of the frameworks in use.\nIn turn, these Feature objects are supplied to\nlaunchApp(), which configures and starts your application,\nreturning an App object (which promotes the public API\nof each feature).\naspects ...\nIn feature-u, \"aspect\" is a generalized term used to refer to the\nvarious ingredients that (when combined) constitute your application.\nAspects can take on many different forms: UI Components and Routes\nâ€¢ State Management (actions, reducers, selectors) â€¢\nBusiness Logic â€¢ Startup Initialization Code â€¢\netc. etc. etc.\nNot all aspects are of interest to feature-u ...  only those that\nare needed to setup and launch the app ... all others are considered\nan internal implementation detail of the feature.  As an example,\nconsider the redux state manager: while it uses actions, reducers, and\nselectors ... only reducers are needed to setup and configure redux.\nframework integration ...\nA fundamental goal of feature-u is to automatically configure\nthe framework(s) used in your run-time-stack (by accumulating the\nnecessary resources across all your features).  Because not everyone\nuses the same frameworks, feature-u accomplishes this through\nExtendable Aspects (you can find them in external NPM packages,\nor you can create your own).\nIt is important to understand that the interface to your chosen\nframeworks is not altered in any way.

This extends the aspect\nproperties accepted by the Feature object (for example:\nFeature.reducer for redux, or Feature.logic for\nredux-logic).\nTypically these Aspects are packaged separately in NPM, although you\ncan create your own Aspects (if needed).\n\nOrganize your app into features.\n\nEach feature should be located in it's own directory.\n\nHow you break your app up into features will take some time and\nthought.  There are many ways to approach this from a design\nperspective.\n\nEach feature will promote it's aspect content through a Feature\nobject (using createFeature()).\n\n\n\nYour mainline starts the app by invoking launchApp(),\npassing all Aspects and Features.\n\n\nEasy Peasy!!\nDirectory Structure\nHere is a sample directory structure of an app that uses feature-u:\nsrc/\n  app.js              ... launches app using launchApp()\n\n  feature/\n    index.js          ... accumulate/promote all app Feature objects\n\n    featureA/         ... an app feature\n      actions.js\n      appDidStart.js\n      appWillStart.js\n      comp/\n        ScreenA1.js\n        ScreenA2.js\n      index.js        ... promotes featureA object using createFeature()\n      logic.js\n      reducer.js\n      route.js\n\n    featureB/         ... another app feature\n      ...\n\n  util/               ... common utilities used across all features\n    ...\nEach feature is located in it's own directory, containing it's aspects\n(actions, reducers, components, routes, logic, etc.).\nFeature Object\nEach feature promotes it's aspect content through a\nFeature object (using createFeature()).\nsrc/feature/featureA/index.js\nimport {createFeature}  from 'feature-u';\nimport reducer          from './state';\nimport logic            from './logic';\nimport route            from './route';\nimport appWillStart     from './appWillStart';\nimport appDidStart      from './appDidStart';\n\nexport default createFeature({\n  name:     'featureA',\n  enabled:  true,\n\n  publicFace: {\n    api: {\n      open:  () => ... implementation omitted,\n      close: () => ... implementation omitted,\n    },\n  },\n\n  reducer,\n  logic,\n  route,\n\n  appWillStart,\n  appDidStart,\n});\n\nWe will fill in more detail a bit later, but for now notice that the\nfeature is conveying reducers, logic modules, routes, and does some\ntype of initialization (appWillStart/appDidStart).

As\nan example, consider the redux state manager: while it uses actions,\nreducers, and selectors ... only reducers are needed to setup and\nconfigure redux.\nfeature-u provides a base set of built-in aspects (out-of-the-box)\nbut allows additional aspects to be introduced through it's extendable\nAPI.\n\nBuilt-In aspects:\nThese aspects are promoted directly by the base feature-u package.\nThey provide very rudimentary capabilities, such as feature\nenablement, public API, and application life-cycle hooks.\n\nExtendable aspects:\nThese aspects are promoted by external packages (or self defined\nin your project).  They provide feature-u integration with other\nframeworks (for example redux state management, or\nredux-logic business logic, or navigational routers,\netc.).  They are created with feature-u's extendable API, and are\npackaged separately, so as to not introduce unwanted dependencies.\n\n\n\nFeature Object (relaying aspect content)\nThe Feature object is merely a container that holds\naspect content that is of interest to feature-u.\nEach feature within your application promotes a Feature object (using\ncreateFeature()) that catalogs the\nAspectContent of that feature.\nUltimately, all Feature objects are consumed by launchApp(). \nBuilt-In aspects\nBuilt-in aspects are promoted directly by the base feature-u package.\nThey provide very rudimentary capabilities, such as feature\nenablement, public API, and application life-cycle hooks.\nLike all aspects, Built-In aspect content is relayed through Feature\nobject properties (via createFeature()).\n\nFeature.name\nA string property which represents the identity of the feature.\nFeature names are used to index the App Object by\nfeature (in support of Cross Feature Communication), and are therefore\nguaranteed to be unique.  Application code can also use\nFeature Name in various\nsingle-source-of-truth operations.\n\n\n\nFeature.enabled\nA boolean property that determines whether the feature is enabled or\nnot.  This indicator is typically based on a dynamic expression,\nallowing packaged code to be dynamically enabled/disabled at\nrun-time (please refer to: Feature Enablement).\n\n\n\nFeature.publicFace\nAn optional resource object that is the feature's Public API,\npromoting cross-communication between features.  This object is\nexposed through the App object as: app.{featureName}.{publicFace}\n(please refer to: publicFace and the App Object ).\n\n\n\nFeature.appWillStart\nAn optional Application Life Cycle Hook invoked one time, just\nbefore the app starts up.  This life-cycle hook can do any type of\ninitialization, and/or optionally supplement the app's top-level\ncontent (using a non-null return) (please refer to:\nappWillStart).\n\n\n\nFeature.appDidStart\nAn optional Application Life Cycle Hook invoked one time, immediately\nafter the app has started.  Because the app is up-and-running at\nthis time, you have access to the appState and the dispatch()\nfunction ... assuming you are using redux (when detected by\nfeature-u's plugable aspects) (please refer to:\nappDidStart).\n\n\nExtendable aspects\nfeature-u is extendable!  Extendable Aspects provide feature-u\nintegration with other frameworks (for example redux\nstate management, or redux-logic business logic, etc.).\nFor this reason (by in large) they provide the most value,\nbecause they fully integrate your features into your run-time\nstack!\nExtendable Aspects are packaged separately from feature-u, so as to not\nintroduce unwanted dependencies (because not everyone uses the same\nframeworks).  You pick and choose them based on the framework(s) used\nin your project (matching your project's run-time stack).\nExtendable Aspects are created with feature-u's\nExtension API, using createAspect().  You can\ndefine your own Aspect (if the one you need doesn't already exist)!\nFor more information, please see Extending feature-u.\nLike all aspects, Extendable Aspect content is relayed through Feature\nobject properties (via createFeature()).\nBecause Extendable Aspects are not part of the base feature-u\npackage, it is a bit problematic to discuss them here (they are\neither in a separate npm package, or self contained in your project).\nYou should search the npm registry with the 'feature-u' keyword\nto find the ones that meet your requirements.  With that said, we\nwill briefly discuss the Extendable Aspects that were created in\nconjunction with the initial development of feature-u (just to give\nyou a feel of what is possible).\n\nFeature.reducer via: feature-redux\nfeature-redux is the feature-u integration point\nto redux!\nIt configures redux through the reducerAspect (to be\nsupplied to launchApp()), which extends the Feature object,\nadding support for the Feature.reducer property, referencing\nfeature-based reducers.\nOnly reducers are of interest because that is all that is needed to\nconfigure [redux].  All other redux items (actions, selectors,\netc.) are considered to be an internal implementation detail of the\nfeature.\nThe Feature.reducer content must be embellished by\nslicedReducer(), which provides instructions on how to combine\nmultiple feature-based reducers in constructing the overall\ntop-level application state tree.\nBecause feature-redux manages redux, it also provides an\nintegration hook to other Aspects that need to inject redux\nmiddleware.\nPlease refer to the feature-redux documentation for\ncomplete details.\n\n\n\nFeature.logic via: feature-redux-logic\nfeature-redux-logic is the feature-u integration\npoint to redux-logic!\nIt configures redux-logic through the logicAspect (to be\nsupplied to launchApp()), which extends the Feature object,\nadding support for the Feature.logic property, referencing\nfeature-based logic modules.\nThe following article is an introduction (and motivation) for the\ndevelopment of redux-logic: Where do I put my business logic in a\nReact-Redux\napplication.\nPlease refer to the feature-redux-logic documentation\nfor complete details.\n\n\n\nFeature.route via: feature-router\nfeature-router is the feature-u integration point to\nFeature Routes!\nIt configures Feature Router through the routeAspect (to be\nsupplied to launchApp()), which extends the Feature object,\nadding support for the Feature.route property, referencing routes\ndefined through the featureRoute() function.\nFeature Routes are based on a very simple concept: allow the\napplication state to drive the routes! It operates through a\nseries of registered functional callback hooks, which determine the\nactive screen based on an analysis of the the overall appState.\nThis is particularly useful in feature-based routing, because each\nfeature can promote their own UI components in an encapsulated and\nautonomous way!  Because of this, feature-router is a\npreferred routing solution for feature-u.\nFeature Routes is the recommended solution for feature-based\nnavigation.  You can find more information in the\nFeature Based Routes section.\nPlease refer to the feature-router documentation for\ncomplete details.\n\n\n\nLaunching Your Application\nBy interpreting the set of Aspects and Features that comprise an\napplication, feature-u can actually coordinate the launch of your\napplication (i.e. start it running)!\nThis is accomplished through the launchApp() function.\n\nIt manages the setup and configuration of the frameworks in use,\nsuch as redux, redux-logic, etc.  This is\nbased on a set of supplied plugable Aspects that extend\nfeature-u, integrating external frameworks to match your\nspecific run-time stack.\n\nIt facilitates application life-cycle hooks on the Feature object,\nallowing features to manage things like: initialization and\ninjecting root UI elements, etc.\n\nIt creates and promotes the App object which contains the publicFace\nof all features, facilitating a cross-communication between features.\n\n\nAs a result, your application mainline is very simple and generic.\nThere is no real app-specific code in it ... not even any global\ninitialization!  That is because each feature can inject their own\napp-specific constructs!!  The mainline merely accumulates the\nAspects and Features, and starts the app by invoking launchApp():\nsrc/app.js\nimport React             from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM          from 'react-dom';\nimport {launchApp}       from 'feature-u';\nimport {routeAspect}     from 'feature-router';      // *1*\nimport {reducerAspect}   from 'feature-redux';       // *1*\nimport {logicAspect}     from 'feature-redux-logic'; // *1*\nimport SplashScreen      from './util/comp/SplashScreen';\nimport features          from './feature';           // *2*\n\n\n// define our set of \"plugable\" feature-u Aspects, conforming to our app's run-time stack\nconst aspects = [ // *1*\n  routeAspect,    // Feature Routes ... order: early - it's DOM injection does NOT support children\n  reducerAspect,  // redux          ... order: later -  DOM injection should be on top\n  logicAspect,    // redux-logic    ... order: N/A   - NO DOM injection\n];\n\n\n// configure our Aspects (as needed)\n// ...

(see *2* in the code snippet above).\nReact Registration\nThe launchApp() function uses a\nregisterRootAppElm() callback (see *3* in the code\nsnippet above) to catalog the supplied rootAppElm to the specific\nReact platform in use.\nAPI: registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm): void\nNOTE regarding the rootAppElm:\n\nTypically the supplied rootAppElm will have definition, based on the\nAspects and Features that are in use.  In this case, it is the\nresponsibility of this callback to register this content in some way\n(either directly or indirectly).\n\nHowever, there are atypical isolated cases where the supplied\nrootAppElm can be null.  This can happen when the app chooses NOT to\nuse Aspects/Features that inject any UI content.  In this case, the\ncallback is free to register it's own content.\n\n\nBecause this registration is accomplished by your app-specific code,\nfeature-u can operate in any of the React platforms, such as:\nReact Web\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n...\nexport default launchApp({\n  aspects,\n  features,\n  registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm) { // *3*\n    ReactDOM.render(rootAppElm,\n                    getElementById('myAppRoot'));\n  }\n});\n\nReact Native\nimport {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';\n...\nexport default launchApp({\n  aspects,\n  features,\n  registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm) { // *3*\n    AppRegistry.registerComponent('myAppKey',\n                                  ()=>rootAppElm); // convert rootAppElm to a React Component\n  }\n});\n\nExpo\nimport Expo from 'expo';\n...\nexport default launchApp({\n  aspects,\n  features,\n  registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm) { // *3*\n    Expo.registerRootComponent(()=>rootAppElm); // convert rootAppElm to a React Component\n  }\n});\n\n\nApp Object\nAn App object is emitted from the launchApp()\nfunction, which promotes the accumulated Public API of all features\n(see: publicFace and the App Object).\nThe App object should be exported (see *4* in the code\nsnippet above) so other modules can access it (providing\nCross Feature Communication).  Please note that depending on the context,\nthere are various techniques by which the App object can be accessed\n(see: Accessing App).\nThe App object contains named feature nodes, structured as follows:\nApp.{featureName}.{publicFace}\n\nThe app object can be used for two distinct purposes: \n\nto access a feature's Public API, and\nto determine whether a feature exists.\n\nFeature Public API\nThe App object promotes the feature's Public API\n(i.e. it's publicFace).\nAs an example, an application that has two features (featureA, and\nfeatureB) will look like this:\napp: {\n  featureA: {\n    action: {\n      open(),\n      close()\n    }\n  },\n  featureB: {\n  }\n}\n\nYou can see that featureA is promoting a couple of actions (open(),\nclose()) in it's publicFace, while featureB has NO publicFace.\nDoes Feature Exist\nThe App object can be used to determine if a feature is\npresent or not.  If a feature does not exist, or has been disabled,\nthe corresponding app.{featureName} will NOT exist.\n\nIt could be that featureA will conditionally use featureB if it\nis present.\nif (app.featureB) {\n  ... do something featureB related\n}\n\n\nIt could be that featureC unconditionally requires that featureD\nis present.  This can be checked in the appWillStart()\nApplication Life Cycle Hook.\nappWillStart({app, curRootAppElm}) {\n  assert(app.featureD, '***ERROR*** I NEED featureD');\n}\n\n\n\n"},"appLifeCycle.html":{"url":"appLifeCycle.html","title":"Application Life Cycle Hooks","keywords":"","body":"Application Life Cycle Hooks\nBecause feature-u is in control of launching the app, application life\ncycle hooks can be introduced, allowing features to perform\napp-specific initialization, and even inject components into the\nroot of the app.\nTwo hooks are provided through the following built-in\nFeature aspects:\n\nFeature.appWillStart - invoked one time at app startup time\nFeature.appDidStart   - invoked one time immediately after app has started\n\nappWillStart\nThe Feature appWillStart() life-cycle hook is invoked one\ntime, just before the app starts up.\nAPI: appWillStart({app, curRootAppElm}): rootAppElm || falsy\nThis life-cycle hook can do any type of initialization.

For example, as a general rule, actions are created\nand consumed exclusively by logic and reducers that are internal to\nthat feature.\nHowever, there are cases where a feature needs to publicly promote\nsome aspects to another feature.  As an example, featureA may:\n\nneed to know some aspect of featureB (say some state value through\na selector),\nor emit/monitor one of it's actions,\nor in general anything (i.e. invoke some function that does xyz).\n\nYou can think of this as the feature's Public API, and it promotes\ncross-communication between features.\nA best practice is to treat each of your features as isolated\nimplementations.  As a result, a feature should never directly\nimport resources from other features, rather they should utilize\nthe public feature promotion of the App object\n(discussed here).  In doing this a: only the public aspects of a\nfeature are exposed/used, and b: your features become truly\nplug-and-play.\nLet's see how Cross Communication is accomplished in feature-u:\n\npublicFace and the App Object\nAccessing the App Object\nManaged Code Expansion\nApp Access Summary\n\n\n\npublicFace and the App Object\nIn feature-u, this cross-feature-communication is accomplished through\nthe Feature.publicFace built-in aspect property.\nA feature can expose whatever it deems necessary through it's publicFace.\nThere are no real constraints on this resource.  It is truly open.\nTypically it is a container of functions of some sort.\nHere is a suggested sampling:\nexport default createFeature({\n  name:     'featureA',\n\n  publicFace: {\n\n    actions: {   // ... JUST action creators that need public promotion (i.e. NOT ALL)\n      open: actions.view.open,\n    },\n\n    sel: { // ... JUST selectors that need public promotion (i.e. NOT ALL)\n      currentView:   selector.currentView,\n      isDeviceReady: selector.isDeviceReady,\n    },\n\n    api,\n\n  },\n\n  ...\n});\n\nThe publicFace of all features are accumulated and exposed through\nthe App Object (emitted from launchApp()), as\nfollows:\nApp.{featureName}.{publicFace}\n\nAs an example, the sample above can be referenced like this: \n  app.featureA.sel.isDeviceReady(appState)\n\nAccessing the App Object\nThe App object can be accessed in several different ways.\n\nThe simplest way to access the App object is to merely\nimport it.\nYour application mainline exports the launchApp() return\nvalue ... which is the App object.\nsrc/app.js\n...\n\n// launch our app, exposing the feature-u App object (facilitating cross-feature communication)!\nexport default launchApp({\n  ...\n});\n\nImporting the app object is a viable technique for run-time\nfunctions (such as UI Components), where the code is\na: not under the direct control of feature-u, and\nb: executed after all aspect expansion has completed.\nThe following example is a UI Component that displays a\ndeviceStatus obtained from an external startup feature\n... accessing the app through an import:\nimport app from '~/app';\n\nfunction ScreenA({deviceStatus}) {\n  return (\n    \n      ...\n      {deviceStatus}\n      ...\n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default connectRedux(ScreenA, {\n  mapStateToProps(appState) {\n    return {\n      deviceStatus: app.device.sel.deviceStatus(appState),\n    };\n  },\n});\n\n\nAnother way to access the App object is through the\nprogrammatic APIs of feature-u, where the app object is supplied\nas a parameter.\n\napp life-cycle hooks:\nappWillStart({app, curRootAppElm}): rootAppElm || null\nappDidStart({app, appState, dispatch}): void\n\n\nroute hooks (PKG: feature-router):\nrouteCB({app, appState}): rendered-component (null for none)\n\n\nlogic hooks (PKG: redux-logic):\ncreateLogic({\n  ...\n  transform({getState, action, app}, next) {\n    ...\n  },\n  process({getState, action, app}, dispatch, done) {\n    ...\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nThere is a third technique to access the App object,\nthat provides early access during code expansion time, that is\nprovided through Managed Code Expansion (see next section).\n\n\nManaged Code Expansion\nIn the previous discussion, we detailed two ways to access the\nApp object, and referred to a third technique (discussed\nhere).\nThere are two situations that make accessing the app object\nproblematic, which are: a: in-line code expansion (where the app\nmay not be fully defined), and b: order dependencies (across\nfeatures).\nTo illustrate this, the following redux-logic module is\nmonitoring an action defined by an external feature (see *1*).\nBecause this app reference is made during code expansion time, the\nimport will not work, because the app object has not yet been fully\ndefined.  This is a timing issue.\nimport app from '~/app'; // *1*\n\nexport const myLogicModule = createLogic({\n\n  name: 'myLogicModule',\n  type: String(app.featureB.actions.fooBar), // *1* app NOT defined during in-line expansion\n\n  process({getState, action}, dispatch, done) {\n    ... \n  },\n\n});\n\nWhen aspect content definitions require the app object at code\nexpansion time, you can wrap the definition in a\nmanagedExpansion() function.  In other words, your aspect\ncontent can either be the actual content itself (ex: a reducer), or a\nfunction that returns the content.\nYour callback function should conform to the following signature:\nAPI: managedExpansionCB(app): AspectContent\nWhen this is done, feature-u will invoke the\nmanagedExpansionCB() in a controlled way, passing the fully\nresolved app object as a parameter.\nTo accomplish this, you must wrap your expansion function with the the\nmanagedExpansion() utility.  The reason for this is that\nfeature-u must be able to distinguish a\nmanagedExpansionCB() function from other functions (ex:\nreducers).\nHere is the same example (from above) that that fixes our\nproblem by replacing the app import with managedExpansion():\n                             // *1* we replace app import with managedExpansion()\nexport const myLogicModule = managedExpansion( (app) => createLogic({\n\n  name: 'myLogicModule',\n  type: String(app.featureB.actions.fooBar), // *1* app now is fully defined\n\n  process({getState, action}, dispatch, done) {\n    ... \n  },\n\n}) );\n\nBecause managedExpansionCB() is invoked in a controlled way\n(by feature-u), the supplied app parameter is guaranteed to be\ndefined (issue a).  Not only that, but the supplied app object\nis guaranteed to have all features publicFace definitions resolved\n(issue b).\nSideBar: A secondary reason managedExpansion() may be\nused (over and above app injection during code expansion) is to\ndelay code expansion, which can avoid issues related to\n(legitimate but somewhat obscure) circular dependencies.\nApp Access Summary\nTo summarize our discussion of how to access the App\nobject, it is really very simple:\n\nSimply import the app (for run-time functions outside the control\nof feature-u).\n\nUse the app parameter supplied through feature-u's programmatic\nAPIs (when using route, live-cycle hooks, or logic hooks).\n\nUse the app parameter supplied through\nmanagedExpansion() (when app is required during in-line\nexpansion of code).\n\n\nAccessing Feature Resources in a seamless way is a rudimentary\nbenefit of feature-u that alleviates a number of problems in your\ncode, making your features truly plug-and-play.\nNOTE: It is possible that a module may be using more than one of\nthese techniques.  As an example a logic module may have to use\nmanagedExpansion() to access app at expansion time, but is\nalso supplied app as a parameter in it's functional hook.  This is\nperfectly fine, as they will be referencing the exact same app object\ninstance.\n"},"featureRouter.html":{"url":"featureRouter.html","title":"Feature Based Routes","keywords":"","body":"Feature Based Routes\nfeature-u recommends that you consider using Feature Routes\nfor your routing needs ... via the feature-router\nextendable Aspect (packaged separately).\nYou may be surprised to discover that feature-u recommends it's own\nflavor of route management.

Basically the\nfirst non-null return wins.\nIn feature based routing, you will not find the typical \"route path to\ncomponent\" mapping catalog, where (for example) some pseudo\nroute('signIn') directive causes the SignIn screen to display\n(which in turn causes the system to accommodate the request by\nadjusting it's state).\nIn other words, you will never see application logic that re-routes to\na signIn screen after checking to see if the user is authenticated.\nRather, the appState is king!  If the user is NOT authenticated\n(based on the route's analysis of the appState) the SignIn screen is\nautomatically displayed ... Easy Peasy!\nDepending on your perspective, this approach can be more robust and\nnatural, but more importantly (once again), it allows features\nto promote their own screens in an encapsulated and autonomous way!\nHow do I proceed?\nThis discussion is obviously merely an introduction.

It operates in an open plugable\narchitecture where Extendable Aspects integrate feature-u to other\nframeworks, matching your specific run-time stack.

For extra credit,\nyou should consider publishing your package, so other XYZ users can\nbenefit from your work!\n\n\nIt is important to understand that feature-u does not alter the\ninterface to these frameworks in any way.  You use them the same way\nyou always have.  feature-u merely provides a well defined\norganizational layer, where the frameworks are automatically\nsetup and configured by accumulating the necessary resources across all\nyour features.\nLocating Extensions\nTo locate the latest set of published feature-u extensions, simply\nsearch the npm registry using a 'feature-u' keyword.  All\npackages that extend feature-u should include this keyword in\ntheir package.\nDuring feature-u's initial release (3/2018), I published the three\nAspects mentioned above (matching my preferred stack), so at that\ntime there were three plugins.  Assuming feature-u gains momentum,\nthe hope is that other authors will contribute their work.\nIf you create your own extension and decide to publish it, don't\nforget to include the 'feature-u' keyword in your package, so\nothers can easily locate your extension.\nAspect Object (extending feature-u)\nTo extend feature-u, you merely define and promote an\nAspect object (using createAspect()).\nThe Aspect object promotes a series of life-cycle methods\nthat feature-u invokes in a controlled way.  This life-cycle is\ncontrolled by launchApp() ... it is supplied the Aspects,\nand it invokes their methods.\nThe essential characteristics of the Aspect life-cycle is\nto:\n\naccumulate AspectContent across all features\nperform the desired setup and configuration\nexpose the framework in some way (by injecting a component in the\nroot DOM, or some Aspect Cross Communication\nmechanism)\n\nFor complete details, please refer to the section on\nAspect Life Cycle Methods.\nDefining rootAppElm\nIn feature-u the rootAppElm is the top-level react DOM that\nrepresents the display of the entire application.\nThis is a non-changing omnipresent DOM that achieves it's dynamics\nthrough a series of both framework components and application injected\nutilities.  As an example, a typical rootAppElm may contain:\n\na navigational component providing screen dynamics (through an Aspect Framework injection)\na state promotional component making state available to subordinates (through an Aspect Framework injection)\na notification utility (through an application Feature injection)\na left-nav menu (through an application Feature injection)\netc. etc. etc.\n\nThe rootAppElm is defined through a progressive accumulation of DOM\ninjections, using a combination of both Aspects and\nFeatures.\nThere are three API's involved and they all accept a curRootAppElm\nparameter, and return a new rootAppElm that includes the supplied\nelement, accommodating the accumulative process.\nThe three API's are listed here, and are executed in this order.\nThey include life-cycle-hooks that are defined from both\nAspects and Features.\n\nAspect.initialRootAppElm(app, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\nFeature.appWillStart({app, curRootAppElm}): rootAppElm || falsy\nAspect.injectRootAppElm(app, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\n\nIt is important to understand that the Feature hook is\nsandwiched between the two Aspect hooks.  Without this\ninsight, you would most certainly wonder what the difference was\nbetween the two Aspect hooks.\nA null rootAppElm seeds the entire process.  The first hook is used\nby any Aspect that wishes to inject itself before all others ... and\nso on.  The end result is a DOM hierarchy where the first injected\nelement is manifest at the bottom of the hierarchy, and the last\ninjection ends up on top.\nTo put this in perspective, let's analyze an example where we are\nusing two Aspects (feature-redux, and\nfeature-router), and an application Feature that manages a\nleft-nav menu available throughout the application.\n\nThe Aspect for feature-router (routeAspect) injects a\n component that (by design) can have no other\nchildren.  Therefore it uses the first api:\nrouteAspect: Aspect.initialRootAppElm()\nfunction initialRootAppElm(app, curRootAppElm) {\n  // insure we don't clobber any supplied content\n  // ... by design,  doesn't support children\n  if (curRootAppElm) {\n    throw new Error('*** ERROR*** Please register routeAspect (from feature-router) before other Aspects ' +\n                    'that inject content in the rootAppElm ...  does NOT support children.');\n  }\n\n  // seed the rootAppElm with our StateRouter\n  return ;\n}\n\n\nThe leftNav application feature, injects it's Drawer/SideBar\ncomponent through the second API (the only one available to\nFeatures):\nleftNav: Feature.appWillStart()\nfunction appWillStart({app, curRootAppElm}) {\n  return (\n     registerDrawer(ref) }\n            content={}\n            onClose={closeSideBar}>\n      {curRootAppElm}\n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nThe Aspect for feature-redux (reducerAspect) injects the redux\n component that must encompass all other components\n(i.e. be on top). Therefore it uses the third API:\nreducerAspect: Aspect.injectRootAppElm()\nfunction injectRootAppElm(app, curRootAppElm) {\n  return (\n    \n      {curRootAppElm}\n    \n  );\n}\n\n\n\nThe end result of this example generates the following DOM:\n\n   registerDrawer(ref) }\n          content={}\n          onClose={closeSideBar}>\n    \n  \n\nAspect Cross Communication\nSome Aspects will rely on an Aspect Cross Communication mechanism\nto accomplish their work (not to be confused with\nCross Feature Communication).\nAspect Cross Communication is where an Aspect requires\nadditional information (over and above it's\nAspectContent) either from other Aspects or\nFeatures.  Therefore the extending Aspect must define\n(and use) additional Aspect/Feature APIs.\nAs an example of this, consider the feature-redux plugin.\nBecause it manages redux, it also maintains the\nredux middleware.  As a result, it must provide a way for\nother Aspects to inject their middleware.  It accomplishes this by\nexposing a new Aspect API: Aspect.getReduxMiddleware().\n\nAn extending Aspect that introduces a new API should do the\nfollowing:\n\nDocument the API, so the external client knows how to use it.\n\nRegister the API, allowing it to pass feature-u validation.\nDepending on whether this is an API for a Aspect or\nFeature, use one of the following:\n\nAPI: extendAspectProperty(name, owner): void\nAPI: extendFeatureProperty(name, owner): void\n\nThis registration allows the new API (i.e. the name parameter)\nto be referenced in either createAspect() or\ncreateFeature() respectively.\nThis registration should occur in the Aspect.genesis()\nlife cycle method (i.e. very early) to guarantee the new API is\navailable during feature-u validation.\nSideBar: feature-u keeps track of the agent that owns\neach extension through the owner parameter.  Use any string that\nuniquely identifies your utility (such as the aspect's npm\npackage name).  This prevents exceptions when duplicate\nextension requests are made by the same owner.  This can happen\nwhen multiple instances of an aspect type are supported, and also\nin unit testing.\n\nUtilize the API in one of the\nAspect Life Cycle Methods to gather the\nadditional information (from other Aspects or\nFeatures).\n\n\n\nExample: \nAs a concrete example of this, let's look at some code snippets\nfrom the aforementioned feature-redux plugin:\n\nHere is how the new API is documented:\nfeature-redux#inputs\n\nMiddleware Integration:\nBecause feature-redux manages redux, other Aspects\ncan promote their redux middleware through\nfeature-redux's Aspect.getReduxMiddleware() API (an\nAspect Cross Communication mechanism).  As\nan example, the feature-redux-logic Aspect integrates\nredux-logic.\n\n\n\nHere is the new API registration:\nfeature-redux/src/reducerAspect.js\n/**\n * Register feature-redux proprietary Aspect APIs (required to pass\n * feature-u validation).\n * This must occur early in the life-cycle (i.e. this method) to\n * guarantee the new API is available during feature-u validation.\n */\nfunction genesis() {\n  extendAspectProperty('getReduxStore', 'feature-redux');      // Aspect.getReduxStore(): store\n  extendAspectProperty('getReduxMiddleware', 'feature-redux'); // Aspect.getReduxMiddleware(): reduxMiddleware\n}\n\n\nHere is the new API usage:\nfeature-redux-logic/src/logicAspect.js\n/**\n * Expose our redux middleware that activates redux-logic.  \n *\n * This method is consumed by the feature-redux Aspect using an\n * \"aspect cross-communication\".\n *\n * @private\n */\nfunction getReduxMiddleware() {\n  return this.logicMiddleware;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect Life Cycle Methods\nThe following list represents a complete compilation of all Aspect\nLife Cycle Methods.  Simply follow the link for a thorough\ndiscussion of each:\n\nAspect.name\nAspect.genesis(): string\nAspect.validateFeatureContent(feature): string\nAspect.expandFeatureContent(app, feature): string\nAspect.assembleFeatureContent(app, activeFeatures): void\nAspect.assembleAspectResources(app, aspects): void\nAspect.initialRootAppElm(app, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\nAspect.injectRootAppElm(app, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\nAspect.config\nAspect.additionalMethods()\n\nNotes of Interest ...\n\nExecution Order: \nThe order in which these methods are presented (above) represent\nthe same order they are executed.\n\n\n\nAspect State Retention: \nIt is not uncommon for an Aspect to use more than one of these\nlife cycle methods to do it's work.  When this happens, typically\nthere is a need for state retention (in order to pick up in one\nstep where it left off in another).\nAs an example, an Aspect may:\n\nuse Aspect.assembleFeatureContent() to assemble it's\ncontent across all features ... retaining the content\n\nand then use Aspect.injectRootAppElm() to promote the\ncontent assembled in the prior step\n\n\nThis state retention can be implemented in a number of different\nways, depending on your philosophy and run-time environment.  For\nexample, you could use the module context of an ES6 environment, or\nalternatively the Aspect object instance itself.\nThe latter is available (should you choose to use it) because\nthese hooks are in fact methods of the Aspect object.  In other\nwords, this is bound to the Aspect object instance.  As a\nresult, you are free to use this for your state retention.\n\n\n\nApp Parameter: \nYou will notice that the app parameter is supplied on many of these\nlife cycle methods.  As you know the App object is used\nin promoting Cross Feature Communication.  \nWhile it is most likely an anti-pattern to directly interrogate the\nApp object within the Aspect, it is frequently required to\n\"pass through\" to downstream processes (as an opaque object).\nThis is the reason the App object is supplied!!\nAs examples of this:\n\nThe Feature.logic aspect (feature-redux-logic) will\ndependency inject (DI) the app object into the\nredux-logic process.\n\nThe Feature.route aspect (feature-router)\ncommunicates the app in it's routing callbacks.\n\netc. etc. etc.\n\n\n\n\nAspect.name\nThe Aspect.name is used to \"key\" AspectContent of this\ntype in the Feature object.  \nFor example: an Aspect.name: 'xyz' would permit a Feature.xyz:\nxyzContent construct.\nAs a result, Aspect names cannot clash with built-in aspects, and\nthey must be unique (across all aspects that are in-use).\nBest Practice ...\nIt is a good practice to allow your Aspect name to be re-configured at\nrun-time because they must be unique, and externally published\nAspects cannot know the Aspect mix that is in-use.  This can be\naccomplished through a defensive Aspect implementation that references\nfeature properties by indexing the Aspect.name rather than hard coding\nit.\nAs an example, the following code snippet assumes a context of an xyz\nAspect method ...\nxyzAspect.someMethod():\n  ...\n  const feature = ...;\n\n  // DO NOT HARD CODE:\n  ... feature.xyz\n\n  // RATHER INDEX:\n  ... feature[this.name]\n\nThis allows your clientele to reset the Aspect.name as follows:\nclient code initialization:\n  xyzAspect.name = 'xyzFoo';\n\nAspect.genesis()\nAPI: genesis(): string\ngenesis() is an optional Life Cycle Hook invoked one\ntime, at the very beginning of the app's start up process.\nThis hook can perform Aspect related initialization and\nvalidation:\n\ninitialization: this is where where proprietary Aspect/Feature\nAPIs should be registered (if any) - via\nextendAspectProperty() and\nextendFeatureProperty() (please see:\nAspect Cross Communication).\n\nvalidation: this is where an aspect can verify it's own required\nconfiguration (if any). Some aspects require certain settings (set\nby the application) in self for them to operate.\n\n\nRETURN: an error message string when self is in an invalid state\n(falsy when valid).  Because this validation occurs under the control\nof launchApp(), any message is prefixed with: 'launchApp() parameter\nviolation: '.\nAspect.validateFeatureContent()\nAPI: validateFeatureContent(feature): string\nvalidateFeatureContent() is a validation hook allowing\nthis aspect to verify it's content on the supplied feature (which is\nknown to contain this aspect).\nRETURN: an error message string when the supplied feature contains\ninvalid content for this aspect (falsy when valid).  Because this\nvalidation conceptually occurs under the control of\ncreateFeature(), any message is prefixed with:\n'createFeature() parameter violation: '.\nAspect.expandFeatureContent()\nAPI: expandFeatureContent(app, feature): string\nexpandFeatureContent() is an optional aspect expansion\nhook, defaulting to the algorithm defined by managedExpansion().\nThis method (when used) should expand self's\nAspectContent in the supplied feature (which is known to\ncontain this aspect and is in need of expansion), replacing that\ncontent (within the feature).\nOnce expansion is complete, feature-u will perform a delayed\nvalidation of the expanded content.\nThe default behavior simply implements the expansion algorithm\ndefined by managedExpansion():\nfeature[this.name] = feature[this.name](app);\n\nThis default behavior rarely needs to change.  It however provides a\nhook for aspects that need to transfer additional content from the\nexpansion function to the expanded content.  As an example, the\nreducer aspect must transfer the slice property from the expansion\nfunction to the expanded reducer.\nRETURN: an optional error message string when the supplied feature\ncontains invalid content for this aspect (falsy when valid).

This hook is executed after all the\naspects have assembled their feature content (i.e. after\nassembleFeatureContent()).\nThis is an optional second-pass (so-to-speak) of Aspect data\ngathering, that facilitates\nAspect Cross Communication.  It allows an\nextending aspect to gather resources from other aspects, using an\nadditional API (ex: Aspect.getXyz()).\nAs an example of this, consider feature-redux.

Configurations (if any) should be documented by the specific\nAspect, and if required, should be validated in the\nAspect.genesis() hook.\nThe config sub-object is \"open\" in the sense that any content is\nallowed.  In other words there is no need to pre-register acceptable\nproperties on the config sub-object (as there is in direct properties\nof the Aspect object ... i.e. extendAspectProperty()).\nIn addition to configuration, it is common for Aspects to use the\nconfig sub-object for hidden diagnostic purposes (hidden in the\nsense that they are not documented).  These settings are employed\nwhen researching an issue, and typically alter behavior in some way or\nglean additional information.  As such they would only be communicated\nto users on a case-by-case basis.\nAspect.additionalMethods()\nAspects may contain additional \"proprietary\" methods in support of\nAspect Cross Communication ... a contract\nbetween one or more aspects.

How do you encapsulate your features while\npulling them back together so they operate as one application?\nThis list (below) provides some considerations that formed the basis\nof why feature-u was developed!\nI hope you enjoy this effort, and comments are always welcome.\n\nP.S. The feature-u library was pulled from a sandbox project\neatery-nod that I use to study several technologies and\nframeworks.  It is a react-native expo mobile\napp.\nP.P.S. If you are wondering what the \"-u\" stands for, it is merely a\nsuccinct suffix that distinguishes a number of my published\nutilities.\nAs promised, here is the list ...\n\nFeature Encapsulation:\nMost characteristics of a feature strive to be self-sufficient and\nindependent.  Where possible, they operate within their own\nisolated implementation.\nSolution: Various feature-u traits\n\nFeature Collaboration:\nEven though a feature's implementation is encapsulated, it still\nneeds to interact with it's surroundings.  There is a need for\ncollaboration between features.  This however should be accomplished\nthrough a well-defined feature-based public interface.\nSolution: Cross Feature Communication\n\nFeature Initialization:\nAny given feature should not have to rely on an external startup\nprocess to perform the initialization that it needs.  Rather, the\nfeature should be able to spawn initialization that it depends on.\nThis could be any number of things, such as:\n\ninitialize some service API\ninject a utility react component at the root of the App\ndispatch an action that kicks off some startup process\netc.\n\nSolution: Application Life Cycle Hook\n\nFeature Enablement:\nYou may have the need for selected features to be dynamically\nenabled or disabled.  As an example, certain features may only be\nenabled with a license upgrade, or other features may only be used for\ndiagnostic purposes.\nSolution: Feature Enablement\n\nResource Resolution during Code Expansion:\nThere are situations where resource access can be problematic. This\nis typically a timing issue, during in-line code expansion,\nwhere the resource is not fully defined YET.  This ultimately is\ndue to order dependencies across features.  \nHow can this problem be minimized?\nSolution: Managed Code Expansion\n\nFramework Integration:\nMost likely your application employs a number of different\nframeworks (ex: redux, redux-logic, etc.).\nAs a result, your features are typically going to rely on these\nsame frameworks.\nHow are the resources needed by these frameworks accumulated and\nconfigured across the many features of your app?\nSolution: Extendable aspects -and- Launching Your Application\n\nUI Component Promotion:\nFeatures that maintain their own UI components need a way to promote\nthem in the overall app's GUI.  How is this accomplished in an\nautonomous way?\nSolution: Feature Based Routes (via the plugable\nfeature-router routeAspect)\n\nSingle Source of Truth:\nWhat are some Best Practices for \"Single Source of Truth\" as it\nrelates to features, and how can feature-u help?\nSolution: see: Best Practices\n\nSimplified App Startup:\nAfter breaking your application into pieces (i.e. features), how do\nyou pull it all together, and actually start your app running?\nAt first glance, this may seem like a daunting task.  As it\nturns out, however, because of the structure promoted by feature-u,\nit actually is a very simple process.\nSolution: Launching Your Application\n\n\n"},"history.html":{"url":"history.html","title":"Revision History","keywords":"","body":"Revision History\nThe feature-u project adheres to Semantic\nVersioning.
