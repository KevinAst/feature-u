# Change Log

The [feature-u](https://feature-u.js.org) project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

Each release is documented on the [Revision
History](https://feature-u.js.org/cur/history.html) page *(in addition
to the [Github Release
Notes](https://github.com/KevinAst/feature-u/releases))*, and
**contains migration instructions**.

## Versioned Docs

**feature-u** maintains version-specific documentation for all of it's
releases ... ex: https://feature-u.js.org/0.1.0/.

This allows you to match the correct documentation to the specific
version you are using.

For your convenience the base https://feature-u.js.org/ will always
reference the most current release.
