is a utility library that facilitates feature-based\nproject organization in your react project.  It assists\nin organizing your project by individual features.\nMost software engineers would agree that organizing your project by\nfeature is much preferred over type-based patterns.  As\napplication domains grow in the real world, project organization by\ntype simply doesn't scale, it just becomes unmanageable!  There are a\nnumber of good articles that discuss this topic (with insights on\nfeature-based design and structure).\nfeature-u is a utility library that manages and streamlines this\nprocess.  It automates some of the mundane details of managing features\nand helps in promoting features that are plug-and-play.\nThe following article is an introduction to feature-u with\nexamples from a real-world app: eatery-nod (where\nfeature-u was conceived):\nfeature-u: Feature Based Project Organization for React.\nfeature-u allows you to focus your attention on the \"business\nend\" of your features!\nGo forth and compute!!\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAt a Glance\n\nBenefits ... understand the benefits of feature-u\n\nGetting Started ... installation and access\n\nBasic Concepts ... learn high-level feature-u concepts\n\nUsage ... what is feature-u's fundamental usage pattern\n\nA Closer Look ... delve deeper into feature-u concepts\n\nApplication Life Cycle Hook ... learn how features can initialize themselves\n\nCross Feature Communication ... promote truly Plug-and-Play features through a well-defined Public Face\n\nUI Composition ...  facilitate seamless cross-feature component composition\n\nFeature Based Routes ... learn how navigation and routing can be integrated into your features\n\nFeature Enablement ... dynamically enable/disable your features\n\nBest Practices ... what are some feature-based best practices and single-source-of-truth principles\n\nCore API ... the detailed reference API\n\nExtending ...\n\nExtending feature-u ... learn how to extend feature-u\n\nExtension API ... the detailed Extension API reference\n\n\n\nMisc ...\n\nDistribution ... where to find feature-u\n\nWhy feature-u? ... why was feature-u created?\n\nRevision History ... peruse the various revisions of feature-u\n\nMIT License ... legal stuff\n\n\n\n\n"},"benefits.html":{"url":"benefits.html","title":"Benefits","keywords":"","body":"Benefits\nThe benefits of using feature-u are many!\nThe list (accumulated below) can be directly correlated to the\nconsiderations that formed the basis of why feature-u was\ndeveloped (see: Why feature-u?).\n\nFeature Encapsulation:\nisolating feature boundaries improves code manageability\n\nFeature Collaboration:\npromote Cross Feature Communication through a well-defined\nfeature-based Public Interface\n\nFeature Based UI Composition:\nfacilitate seamless cross-feature component composition\n\nApplication Life Cycle Hooks:\nfeatures can initialize themselves without relying on an external\nprocess\n\nFeature Enablement:\n enable/disable features through a run-time switch\n\nMinimize Feature Order Dependency Issues\nduring in-line code expansion\n\nFramework Integration:\nautomatically configure used framework(s) (matching the app's\nrun-time-stack) by accumulating all feature aspects (employing an\nextendable API)\n\nUI Component Promotion:\nfeatures can autonomously promote their UI components through\nFeature Based Route Management\n\nSingle Source of Truth:\nis facilitated in a number of ways within a feature's\nimplementation\n\nSimplified App Startup:\nlaunching an app can be accomplished through a single line of\nexecutable code!\n\nOperates in any React Platform\nReact Web, React Native, Expo, etc.\n\nPlug-and-Play:\nfeatures can be more easily added or removed\n\n\nfeature-u allows you to focus your attention on the \"business\nend\" of your features!\nGo forth and compute!!\n"},"start.html":{"url":"start.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nInstall\n\npeerDependencies:\nfeature-u has a peerDependency on react (most likely you should\nalready have this installed ... but just in case):\nnpm install --save react\n\n=0.14.0   USAGE: React Context and JSX (in withFassets.js and launchApp.js)\n---> \n\nthe main event:\nnpm install --save feature-u\n\n\n\nAccess\nAll functions are exposed through UMD,\nand therefore accessible through any one of the following techniques ...\n\nES6 Import (Native JS)\nimport { createFeature }  from 'feature-u';\n-OR-\nimport * as FeatureU from 'feature-u';\n-OR-\nimport FeatureU from 'feature-u';\n\ncreateFeature(...)\n-OR-\nFeatureU.createFeature(...)\n\n\n\n\nCommonJS\nconst { createFeature } = require('feature-u');\n-OR-\nconst FeatureU = require('feature-u');\n\ncreateFeature(...)\n-OR-\nFeatureU.createFeature(...)\n\n\n\n\nAMD\ndefine(['feature-u', 'otherModule'], function(FeatureU, otherModule) {\n  FeatureU.createFeature(...)\n});\n\n\n\n\n tag\n\n\n\n  FeatureU.createFeature(...)\n\n\n\nPotential Need for Polyfills\nThe implementation of this library employs modern es2015+ JavaScript\nconstructs.

You have decided to structure your project by features.\nFrom a design perspective, there are a number of considerations in\ndetermining the feature boundaries.  Your code has been separated into\nindividual feature directories, and in general, you are feeling good\nabout the progress.\nYour intuition is starting to realize concrete benefits ... feature\nsegregation is going to result in code that much more manageable!\nthe Hurdles ...\nHowever, there are a number of hurdles yet to be resolved ...\n\nHow do you encapsulate and isolate your features, while still\nallowing them to collaborate with one another?\n\nHow do selected features introduce start-up initialization (even\ninjecting utility at the root DOM), without relying on some\nexternal startup process?\n\nHow do you promote feature-based UI components in an isolated and\nautonomous way?\n\nHow do you facilitate UI Composition that crosses feature boundaries?\n\nHow do you configure your chosen frameworks now that your code is\nso spread out?\n\nHow do you enable/disable selected features which are either\noptional, or require a license upgrade?\n\nIn short, how do you pull it all together so that your individual\nfeatures operate as one application?\n\n\nwhat now? (the Goal) ...\nThe overriding goal of feature-u is two fold:\n\nAllow features to Plug-and-Play! This encompasses many things,\nsuch as: encapsulation, cross communication, enablement,\ninitialization, etc., etc.  We will build on these concepts\nthroughout this documentation.\n\nAutomate the startup of your application!! You have the\nfeatures.  Allow them to promote their characteristics, so a\ncentral utility can automatically configure the frameworks used\nin your app, thereby launching your application!\nThis task must be accomplished in an extendable way, because\nnot everyone uses the same set of frameworks!\n\n\nfeature-u Basics\nThe basic process of feature-u is that each feature promotes a\nFeature object that contains various aspects of that\nfeature ... things like: the feature's name, it's Public Interface,\nwhether it is enabled, initialization constructs, and resources used\nto configure it's slice of the frameworks in use.\nIn turn, these Feature objects are supplied to\nlaunchApp(), which configures and starts your application,\nreturning a Fassets object (which promotes the Public Face\nof each feature).\n\naspects ...\nIn feature-u, \"aspect\" is a generalized term used to refer to the\nvarious ingredients that (when combined) constitute your application.\nAspects can take on many different forms: UI Components â€¢ Routes\nâ€¢ State Management (actions, reducers, selectors) â€¢\nBusiness Logic â€¢ Startup Initialization Code â€¢\netc. etc. etc.\nNot all aspects are of interest to feature-u ...  only those that\nare needed to setup and launch the app ... all others are considered\nan internal implementation detail of the feature.  As an example,\nconsider the redux state manager: while it uses actions, reducers, and\nselectors ... only reducers are needed to setup and configure redux.\nframework integration ...\nA fundamental goal of feature-u is to automatically configure\nthe framework(s) used in your run-time-stack (by accumulating the\nnecessary resources across all your features).  Because not everyone\nuses the same frameworks, feature-u accomplishes this through\nExtendable Aspects (you can find them in external NPM packages,\nor you can create your own).\nIt is important to understand that the interface to your chosen\nframeworks is not altered in any way.  You use them the same way you\nalways have (just within your feature boundary).  feature-u\nmerely provides a well defined organizational layer, where the\nframeworks are automatically setup and configured by accumulating the\nnecessary resources across all your features.\n"},"usage.html":{"url":"usage.html","title":"Usage","keywords":"","body":"Usage\nThe basic usage pattern of feature-u is to:\n\nChoose the Aspects that you will need, based on your\nselected frameworks (i.e. your run-time stack).  This extends the\naspect properties accepted by the Feature object (for example:\nFeature.reducer for redux, or Feature.logic for\nredux-logic).\nTypically these Aspects are packaged separately in NPM, although you\ncan create your own Aspects (if needed).\n\nOrganize your app into features.\n\nEach feature should be located in it's own directory.\n\nHow you break your app up into features will take some time and\nthought.  There are many ways to approach this from a design\nperspective.\n\nEach feature will promote it's aspect content through a\nFeature object (using createFeature()).\n\n\n\nYour mainline starts the app by invoking launchApp(),\npassing all Aspects and Features.\n\n\nEasy Peasy!!\nDirectory Structure\nHere is a sample directory structure of an app that uses feature-u:\nsrc/\n  app.js              ... launches app using launchApp()\n\n  feature/\n    index.js          ... accumulate/promote all Feature objects (within the app)\n\n    featureA/         ... a feature (within the app)\n      actions.js\n      appDidStart.js\n      appWillStart.js\n      comp/\n        ScreenA1.js\n        ScreenA2.js\n      index.js        ... promotes featureA object using createFeature()\n      logic.js\n      reducer.js\n      route.js\n\n    featureB/         ... another feature\n      ...\n\n  util/               ... common utilities used across all features\n    ...\nEach feature is located in it's own directory, containing it's aspects\n(actions, reducers, components, routes, logic, etc.).\nFeature Object\nEach feature promotes it's aspect content through a\nFeature object (using createFeature()).\nsrc/feature/featureA/index.js\nimport {createFeature}  from 'feature-u';\nimport reducer          from './state';\nimport logic            from './logic';\nimport route            from './route';\nimport appWillStart     from './appWillStart';\nimport appDidStart      from './appDidStart';\n\nexport default createFeature({\n  name:     'featureA',\n  enabled:  true,\n\n  fassets: {\n    define: {\n      'api.openA':  () => ... implementation omitted,\n      'api.closeA': () => ... implementation omitted,\n    },\n  },\n\n  reducer,\n  logic,\n  route,\n\n  appWillStart,\n  appDidStart,\n});\n\nWe will fill in more detail a bit later, but for now notice that the\nfeature is conveying reducers, logic modules, routes, and does some\ntype of initialization (appWillStart/appDidStart).  It also promotes\nsomething called fassets (feature assets - the Public Face of a\nfeature) with openA() and closeA() functions which will be publicly\npromoted to other features.\nFeature Accumulation\nAll features are accumulated through a single es6 module, allowing\nthem to be pulled in through a single array import.\nsrc/feature/index.js\nimport featureA  from './featureA';\nimport featureB  from './featureB';\n\n// promote ALL our features through a single import (accumulated in an array)\nexport default [\n  featureA,\n  featureB,\n];\n\nNote: While this represents a complete list of all our features,\nsome of them may be disabled (i.e. logically removed) ... see:\nFeature Enablement.\nlaunchApp()\nIn feature-u the application mainline is very simple and generic.\nThere is no real app-specific code in it ... not even any global\ninitialization!

Aspects\ncan take on many different forms ... for example:\n\nUI Components and Routes, \nState Management (actions, reducers, selectors), \nBusiness Logic, \nStartup Initialization Code, \netc.\n\nNot all aspects are of interest to feature-u ...  only those that\nare needed to setup and launch the app ... all others are\nconsidered to be an internal implementation detail of the feature.  As\nan example, consider the redux state manager: while it uses actions,\nreducers, and selectors ... only reducers are needed to setup and\nconfigure redux.\nfeature-u provides a base set of built-in aspects (out-of-the-box)\nbut allows additional aspects to be introduced through it's extendable\nAPI.\n\nBuilt-In aspects:\nThese aspects are promoted directly by the base feature-u package.\nThey provide very rudimentary capabilities, such as feature\nenablement, Public Face, and application life-cycle hooks.\n\nExtendable aspects:\nThese aspects are promoted by external packages (or self defined\nin your project).  They provide feature-u integration with other\nframeworks (for example redux state management, or\nredux-logic business logic, or navigational routers,\netc.).  They are created with feature-u's extendable API, and are\npackaged separately, so as to not introduce unwanted dependencies.\n\n\n\nFeature Object (relaying aspect content)\nThe Feature object is merely a lightweight container that\nholds AspectContent of interest to feature-u.\nEach feature within an application promotes a Feature object (using\ncreateFeature()) which catalogs the aspects of that feature.\nUltimately, all Feature objects are consumed by launchApp(). \nFeature content are simple key/value pairs (the key being an\nAspect.name with values of AspectContent).  These aspects can\neither be built-in (from core feature-u), or extensions.\nHere is an example:\nexport default createFeature({\n  name:     'featureA', // builtin aspect (name must be unique across all features within app)\n  enabled:  true,       // builtin aspect enabling/disabling feature\n\n  fassets: {            // builtin aspect promoting Public Face - Cross Feature Communication\n    define: {\n      'api.openA':  () => ...,\n      'api.closeA': () => ...,\n    },\n  },\n\n  appWillStart: (...) => ..., // builtin aspect (Application Life Cycle Hook)\n  appDidStart:  (...) => ..., // ditto\n\n  reducer: ..., // feature redux reducer (extended aspect from the feature-redux plugin)\n  logic:   ..., // feature logic modules (extended aspect from the feature-redux-logic plugin)\n});\n\nBuilt-In aspects\nBuilt-in aspects are promoted directly by the base feature-u package.\nThey provide very rudimentary capabilities, such as feature\nenablement, Public Face, and application life-cycle hooks.\nLike all aspects, Built-In aspect content is relayed through Feature\nobject properties (via createFeature()).\n\nFeature.name\nA string property which represents the identity of the feature.\nFeature names are guaranteed to be unique.  Application code can\nalso use Feature Name in various\nsingle-source-of-truth operations.\n\n\n\nFeature.enabled\nA boolean property that determines whether the feature is enabled or\nnot.  This indicator is typically based on a dynamic expression,\nallowing packaged code to be dynamically enabled/disabled at\nrun-time (please refer to: Feature Enablement).\n\n\n\nFeature.fassets aspect\nAn optional aspect that promotes feature assets used in\nCross Feature Communication (i.e. the Public Face of a feature).\nfassets directives can both define resources, and/or declare a\nresource contract (the intention to use a set of fasset resources).\nResources are accumulated across all features, and exposed through\nthe Fassets object, and the withFassets()\nHoC. For more information, please see Feature.fassets aspect.\n\n\n\nFeature.appWillStart()\nAn optional Application Life Cycle Hook invoked one time, just\nbefore the app starts up.  This life-cycle hook can do any type of\ninitialization, and/or optionally supplement the app's top-level\ncontent (using a non-null return) (please refer to:\nappWillStart()).\n\n\n\nFeature.appDidStart()\nAn optional Application Life Cycle Hook invoked one time, immediately\nafter the app has started.  Because the app is up-and-running at\nthis time, you have access to the appState and the dispatch()\nfunction ... assuming you are using redux (when detected by\nfeature-u's plugable aspects) (please refer to:\nappDidStart()).\n\n\nExtendable aspects\nfeature-u is extendable!  Extendable Aspects provide feature-u\nintegration with other frameworks (for example redux\nstate management, or redux-logic business logic, etc.).\nFor this reason (by in large) they provide the most value,\nbecause they fully integrate your features into your run-time\nstack!\nExtendable Aspects are packaged separately from feature-u, so as to not\nintroduce unwanted dependencies (because not everyone uses the same\nframeworks).  You pick and choose them based on the framework(s) used\nin your project (matching your project's run-time stack).\nExtendable Aspects are created with feature-u's\nExtension API, using createAspect().  You can\ndefine your own Aspect (if the one you need doesn't already exist)!\nFor more information, please see Extending feature-u.\nLike all aspects, Extendable Aspect content is relayed through Feature\nobject properties (via createFeature()).\nBecause Extendable Aspects are not part of the base feature-u\npackage, it is a bit problematic to discuss them here (they are\neither in a separate npm package, or self contained in your project).\nYou should search the npm registry with the 'feature-u' keyword\nto find the ones that meet your requirements.  With that said, we\nwill briefly discuss the Extendable Aspects that were created in\nconjunction with the initial development of feature-u (just to give\nyou a feel of what is possible).\n\nFeature.reducer via: feature-redux\nfeature-redux is the feature-u integration point\nto redux!\nIt configures redux through the reducerAspect (to be\nsupplied to launchApp()), which extends the Feature object,\nadding support for the Feature.reducer property, referencing\nfeature-based reducers.\nOnly reducers are of interest because that is all that is needed to\nconfigure [redux].  All other redux items (actions, selectors,\netc.) are considered to be an internal implementation detail of the\nfeature.\nThe Feature.reducer content must be embellished by\nslicedReducer(), which provides instructions on how to combine\nmultiple feature-based reducers in constructing the overall\ntop-level application state tree.\nBecause feature-redux manages redux, it also provides an\nintegration hook to other Aspects that need to inject redux\nmiddleware.\nPlease refer to the feature-redux documentation for\ncomplete details.\n\n\n\nFeature.logic via: feature-redux-logic\nfeature-redux-logic is the feature-u integration\npoint to redux-logic!\nIt configures redux-logic through the logicAspect (to be\nsupplied to launchApp()), which extends the Feature object,\nadding support for the Feature.logic property, referencing\nfeature-based logic modules.\nThe following article is an introduction (and motivation) for the\ndevelopment of redux-logic: Where do I put my business logic in a\nReact-Redux\napplication.\nPlease refer to the feature-redux-logic documentation\nfor complete details.\n\n\n\nFeature.route via: feature-router\nfeature-router is the feature-u integration point to\nFeature Routes!\nIt configures Feature Router through the routeAspect (to be\nsupplied to launchApp()), which extends the Feature object,\nadding support for the Feature.route property, referencing routes\ndefined through the featureRoute() function.\nFeature Routes are based on a very simple concept: allow the\napplication state to drive the routes! It operates through a\nseries of registered functional callback hooks, which determine the\nactive screen based on an analysis of the the overall appState.\nThis is particularly useful in feature-based routing, because each\nfeature can promote their own UI components in an encapsulated and\nautonomous way!  Because of this, feature-router is a\npreferred routing solution for feature-u.\nFeature Routes is the recommended solution for feature-based\nnavigation.  You can find more information in the\nFeature Based Routes section.\nPlease refer to the feature-router documentation for\ncomplete details.\n\n\n\nLaunching Your Application\nBy interpreting the set of Aspects and Features that comprise an\napplication, feature-u can actually coordinate the launch of your\napplication (i.e. start it running)!\nThis is accomplished through the launchApp() function.\n\nIt manages the setup and configuration of the frameworks in use,\nsuch as redux, redux-logic, etc.  This is\nbased on a set of supplied plugable Aspects that extend\nfeature-u, integrating external frameworks to match your\nspecific run-time stack.\n\nIt facilitates application life-cycle hooks on the Feature object,\nallowing features to manage things like: initialization and\ninjecting root UI elements, etc.\n\nIt creates and promotes the Fassets object which contains the Public Face\nof all features, facilitating a cross-communication between features.\n\n\nAs a result, your application mainline is very simple and generic.\nThere is no real app-specific code in it ... not even any global\ninitialization!  That is because each feature can inject their own\napp-specific constructs!!  The mainline merely accumulates the\nAspects and Features, and starts the app by invoking launchApp():\nsrc/app.js\nimport React                 from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM              from 'react-dom';\nimport {launchApp}           from 'feature-u';\nimport {createRouteAspect}   from 'feature-router';      // *1*\nimport {createReducerAspect} from 'feature-redux';       // *1*\nimport {createLogicAspect}   from 'feature-redux-logic'; // *1*\nimport SplashScreen          from './util/comp/SplashScreen';\nimport features              from './feature';           // *2*\n\nconst routeAspect   = createRouteAspect();   // *1*\nconst reducerAspect = createReducerAspect(); // *1*\nconst logicAspect   = createLogicAspect();   // *1*\n\n// define our set of \"plugable\" feature-u Aspects, conforming to our app's run-time stack\nconst aspects = [ // *1*\n  routeAspect,    // Feature Routes ... order: early - it's DOM injection does NOT support children\n  reducerAspect,  // redux          ... order: later -  DOM injection should be on top\n  logicAspect,    // redux-logic    ... order: N/A   - NO DOM injection\n];\n\n\n// configure our Aspects (as needed)\n// ... Feature Route fallback screen (when no routes are in effect)\nrouteAspect.config.fallbackElm$ = ;\n\n\n// launch our app, exposing the feature-u Fassets object (facilitating cross-feature communication)!\nexport default launchApp({         // *4*\n  aspects,                         // *1*\n  features,                        // *2*\n  registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm) { // *3*\n    ReactDOM.render(rootAppElm,\n                    getElementById('myAppRoot'));\n  }\n});\n\nThe Aspect collection (see *1* in the code snippet above) reflects\nthe frameworks of our run-time stack (in our example\nredux, redux-logic, and\nfeature-router ) and extend the acceptable Feature\nproperties (Feature.reducer, Feature.logic, and Feature.route\nrespectively) ... see: Extendable aspects.\nIn this case, all our Aspects were pulled from external npm packages,\nhowever you can define your own using createAspect().\nAll of our supplied app features are accumulated from the features/\ndirectory ... (see *2* in the code snippet above).\nExport fassets\nThe Fassets object (emitted from launchApp())\npromotes the accumulated Public Face of all features.  This is the\nbasis of Cross Feature Communication.\nBy feature-u decree, this object should be exported (see *4*\nin the code snippet above), providing import access to other modules.\nSideBar: In reality there are several ways to access the\nfassets object (depending on the context), import is just one\n(see: Obtaining fassets object).\nYou can find more information about the Fassets object in\nCross Feature Communication.\nReact Registration\nThe launchApp() function uses a\nregisterRootAppElm() callback (see *3* in the code\nsnippet above) to catalog the supplied rootAppElm to the specific\nReact platform in use.\nAPI: registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm, fassets): void\nNOTE regarding the rootAppElm:\n\nTypically the supplied rootAppElm will have definition, based on the\nAspects and Features that are in use.  In this case, it is the\nresponsibility of this callback to register this content in some way\n(either directly or indirectly).\n\nHowever, there are atypical isolated cases where the supplied\nrootAppElm can be null.  This can happen when the app chooses NOT to\nuse Aspects/Features that inject any UI content.  In this case, the\ncallback is free to register it's own content.\n\n\nBecause this registration is accomplished by your app-specific code,\nfeature-u can operate in any of the React platforms, such as:\nReact Web\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n...\nexport default launchApp({\n  aspects,\n  features,\n  registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm) { // *3*\n    ReactDOM.render(rootAppElm,\n                    getElementById('myAppRoot'));\n  }\n});\n\nReact Native\nimport {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';\n...\nexport default launchApp({\n  aspects,\n  features,\n  registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm) { // *3*\n    AppRegistry.registerComponent('myAppKey',\n                                  ()=>rootAppElm); // convert rootAppElm to a React Component\n  }\n});\n\nExpo\nimport Expo from 'expo';\n...\nexport default launchApp({\n  aspects,\n  features,\n  registerRootAppElm(rootAppElm) { // *3*\n    Expo.registerRootComponent(()=>rootAppElm); // convert rootAppElm to a React Component\n  }\n});\n\n"},"appLifeCycle.html":{"url":"appLifeCycle.html","title":"Application Life Cycle Hooks","keywords":"","body":"Application Life Cycle Hooks\nBecause feature-u is in control of launching the app, life cycle\nhooks for the application can be introduced, allowing features to\nperform app-specific initialization, and even inject components into\nthe root of the app.\nTwo hooks are provided through the following built-in\nFeature aspects:\n\nFeature.appWillStart - invoked one time at app startup time\nFeature.appDidStart   - invoked one time immediately after app has started\n\nApplication Life Cycle Hooks greatly simplify your app's mainline\nstartup process, because initialization specific to a given feature\ncan be encapsulated in that feature.\nappWillStart\nThe Feature appWillStart() life-cycle hook is invoked one\ntime, just before the app starts up.\nAPI: appWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}): rootAppElm | falsy\nThis life-cycle hook can do any type of initialization.  For example:\ninitialize your database:\nappWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n  initFireBase();\n}\n\nInjecting DOM Content\nIn addition, the appWillStart() life-cycle hook can\noptionally supplement the app's top-level root element (i.e. react\ncomponent instance).

In this case you need to throw\nan error, and emit applicable context in a log.\nHere is an example:\nappWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n  // MyContent does NOT support children\n  // ... insure we don't clobber any supplied content\n  if (curRootAppElm) {\n    const msg = \"***ERROR***  does NOT support children \" +\n                \"but another feature/aspect is attempting to inject it's content. \" +\n                \"Please resolve either by adjusting the feature expansion order, \" +\n                \"or promoting  through the conflicting artifact.\";\n    console.log(`${msg} ... conflicting artifact:`, curRootAppElm);\n    throw new Error(msg);\n  }\n  return ;\n}\n\n\nIn many cases (such as a feature conflict), this can be resolved\nby adjusting the feature expansion order.\n\nIn other cases, it may seem as though you have hit an impasse.  For\nexample, if your content doesn't support children, and an aspect\nyou are using doesn't support children.

There\nare cases where a feature needs to promote a limited subset of it's\naspects to other features.  For example, a feature may need to:\n\nbe knowledgeable of some external state (via a selector)\nemit or monitor actions of other features\nconsolidate component resources from other features - as in UI Composition\ninvoke the API of other features\netc. etc. etc.\n\nThese items form the basis of why Cross Feature Communication is\nneeded.\nTo complicate matters, as a general rule, JS imports should NOT\ncross feature boundaries.  The reason being that this\ncross-communication should be limited to public access points -\nhelping to facilitate true plug-and-play.\nGiven all this then, how is Cross Feature Communication achieved?\nFeatures need a way to promote their Public Face to other\nfeatures, and consume other feature's Public Assets.\nBasic Concepts: fassets\nfeature-u promotes feature-based resources through something\ncalled fassets (feature assets).  This is how all Cross Feature\nCommunication is accomplished.  You can think of this as the Public\nFace of a feature.\nSideBar: The term fassets is a play on words.  While it is\npronounced \"facet\" and is loosely related to this term, it is spelled\nfassets (i.e. feature assets).\nThe fassets terminology is consistently used in both:\n\nthe definition of resources (through the built-in\nFeature.fassets aspect)\n\nand in their usage (through the Fassets object and the\nwithFassets() HoC)\n\n\n\nfassets definition\nA feature can expose whatever it deems necessary through the built-in\nFeature.fassets aspect).  There is no real constraint on this\nresource.  It is truly open.  Typically it is a set of functions or UI\nComponents, but is not limited to that.  It can be a combination of UI\nComponents, actions, selectors, API functions, constants, or whatever\nyour feature needs to promote.\nHere is a simple example of how fassets are defined:\nexport default createFeature({\n\n  name:     'featureA',\n\n  fassets: {\n    define: {\n     'openView':      actions.view.open,      // openView(viewName): Action\n     'currentView':   selector.currentView,   // currentView(appState): viewName\n     'isDeviceReady': selector.isDeviceReady, // isDeviceReady(appState): boolean\n    },\n  },\n\n  ...\n});\n\nAs you can see, the fassets aspect has a define\ndirective where resources are cataloged.\nIn this example, featureA is publicly promoting only three of\nit's many internal aspects ...  one action creator (openView) and\ntwo selectors (currentView, and isDeviceReady).\nfassets usage\nTo use these public resources, feature-u accumulates them from all\nactive features, and promotes them through the\nFassets object (emitted from launchApp()).\nSideBar: There are several ways to obtain access the Fassets object\n(discussed later - Obtaining fassets object).\nTo reference a fassets resource, simply dereference it as any other\nobject reference.  Here is a usage example (using the definition\nabove):\n  fassets.isDeviceReady(appState)\n\nNOTE: In addition to directly dereferencing a resource on the\nfassets object, you can also use the Fassets.get() method\nand the withFassets() HoC (discussed later).  One\nadvantage of these alternatives is you can utilize wildcards to match\nmultiple fasset resources.\nfederated namespace\nfasset keys may contain a federated namespace (using dots -\n.). When this is done, feature-u will normalize them in a\nstructure with depth.\nYou can use federated names however you wish, or not at all.  In\ngeneral it helps categorize or qualify assets in some way.  You may\nwant to qualify by feature name, or process type, or any app-specific\nstructure.\nAs an example, the following define was enhanced (from above) to\ninclude some qualifiers:\nexport default createFeature({\n\n  name:     'featureA',\n\n  fassets: {\n    define: {\n     'action.openView':        actions.view.open,      // openView(viewName): Action\n     'selector.currentView':   selector.currentView,   // currentView(appState): viewName\n     'selector.isDeviceReady': selector.isDeviceReady, // isDeviceReady(appState): boolean\n    },\n  },\n\n  ...\n});\n\nand would be referenced as follows:\n  fassets.selector.isDeviceReady(appState)\n\nUI Composition\nA major benefit of working with React is components.  Components allow\nyou to split your UI into independent, reusable pieces.\nDepending on your feature boundaries, it is very common for a given\ncomponent to be an accumulation of sub-components that span several\nfeatures.  As a result, UI Composition is a very important part of\nCross Feature Communication.\nLet's build some concepts by looking at series of examples.\nConsider a common feature that promotes a series of central\nresources, used throughout our application.  The following snippet\ndemonstrates how a company logo could be promoted to several UI\ncomponents.\ncreateFeature({\n\n  name: 'common',\n\n  fassets: {\n    define: {\n     'company.logo': () => , // a react component\n    },\n  },\n  ... snip snip\n});\n\nSo far nothing new has been introduced in this example.  This is the\nsame type of resource definition that we have seen previously ... it's\njust the resource happens to be a react component.\nwithFassets() HoC\nwithFassets() is a feature-u Higher-order Component\n(HoC) that auto-wires fasset properties into a component.  This is a\ncommon pattern popularized by redux connect() (simplifying\ncomponent access to application state).\nHere is how a component would access the company.logo (defined\nabove):\nfunction MyComponent({Logo}) {\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n    ... snip snip\n  );\n}\n\nexport default withFassets({\n  component: MyComponent,\n  mapFassetsToProps: {\n    Logo: 'company.logo',\n  }\n});\n\nThe withFassets() HoC auto-wires named feature assets as\ncomponent properties through the mapFassetsToProps hook.  In this\nexample, because the Logo property is a component, MyComponent can\nsimply reference it using JSX.\nResource Contracts\nIt is common for UI Composition to be represented as a contract, where\na component in one feature has a series of injection needs that are to\nbe supplied by other features.\nThe fassets aspect has additional constructs to facilitate\nthis contractual arrangement, allowing feature-u to provide more\nvalidation in the process.\nRather than just defining resources in one feature and using them in\nanother:\n\nA given feature can specify a series of injection needs using the\nfassets.use directive.  This identifies a set of injection keys\nthat uniquely identify these resources.\n\nOther features will supply this content using the fassets.defineUse\ndirective, by referencing these same injection keys.\n\n\nThis represents more of a pull philosophy.  It gives feature-u\nmore knowledge of the process, allowing it to verify that supplied\nresources are correct.\nSideBar: The define and defineUse directives are very similar,\nand in some cases can be used interchangeably.  The defineUse\ndirective does everything define does but enforces the additional\nconstraint that it must match a corresponding use request.\nTherefore, if your intent is to to supply content that is formally\nrequested by another feature (via the use directive), defineUse is\npreferred (even though it can be accomplished by define),\nbecause typos can be caught on the definition side.\nFollowing is a composition example that uses this more formal definition.\nIn this example our application has a MainPage, that promotes a\nvariety of sub-components: a ShoppingCart and a Search screen.\nBecause these sub-components are managed by separate features, we need\na way to pull them into the MainPage.\nHere is our main feature:\n\nmain feature\nsrc/features/main/index.js\ncreateFeature({\n  name: 'main',\n\n  fassets: {\n    use: [ // \nThe main feature simply specifies it's need for externally sourced\nsub-content.  This is a contract (so to speak) stating that it plans\nto render this content.\nHere is the manifestation of this contract:\nsrc/features/main/comp/MainPage.js\nfunction MainPage({Logo, CartLink, SearchLink, CartBody, SearchBody,}) {\n  return (\n    \n       {/* header section */}\n        \n      \n\n       {/* left-nav section */}\n        \n        \n      \n\n       {/* body section */}\n        \n        \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default withFassets({\n  component: MainPage,\n  mapFassetsToProps: {\n    Logo:       'company.logo', // from our prior example\n\n    CartLink:   'MainPage.cart.link',\n    CartBody:   'MainPage.cart.body',\n\n    SearchLink: 'MainPage.search.link',\n    SearchBody: 'MainPage.search.body',\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nThe following snippets are taken from other features that supply the\ndefinitions for the content to inject:\n\ncart feature\nsrc/features/cart/index.js\ncreateFeature({\n  name: 'cart',\n\n  fassets: {\n    defineUse: {\n     'MainPage.cart.link': () => Cart,\n     'MainPage.cart.body': () => ,\n    },\n  },\n  ... snip snip\n});\n\n\nsearch feature\nsrc/features/search/index.js\ncreateFeature({\n  name: 'search',\n\n  fassets: {\n    defineUse: {\n     'MainPage.search.link': () => Search,\n     'MainPage.search.body': () => ,\n    },\n  },\n  ... snip snip\n});\n\n\n\nTwo external features (cart and search) define the content\nthat is requested by the main feature.\nThe fassets.defineUse directive requires that the resource keys match a\nfassets.use feature request.  This is the contract that provides\nfeature-u insight when enforcing it's validation.\nSideBar: Because we are also dealing with navigation, we introduce\nreact-router into the mix (with the Link and Route\ncomponents).  Because of RR's V4 design, our routes are also handled\nthrough component composition (see Feature Based Routes for\nmore information).\nWildcards (adding dynamics)\nIn our prior example we explicitly define each injection key, and\nstrategically place it in our parent component.  While this may be\nnecessary in some cases, typically more dynamics are required\n(allowing features to introduce their content autonomously).\nThis can be accomplished by using wildcards (*).\nHere is our refined main feature (NOTE: the definitions\nfrom the defining features are the same, so they are not repeated):\n\nmain feature\nsrc/features/main/index.js\ncreateFeature({\n  name: 'main',\n\n  fassets: {\n    use: [\n       'MainPage.*.link',\n       'MainPage.*.body',\n    ],\n  },\n  ... snip snip\n});\n\nBecause our specification includes wildcards, a series of\ndefinitions will match!\nHere is our refined MainPage component:\nsrc/features/main/comp/MainPage.js\nfunction MainPage({Logo, mainLinks, mainBodies}) {\n  return (\n    \n       {/* header section */}\n        \n      \n\n       {/* left-nav section */}\n        {mainLinks.map( (MainLink, indx) => )}\n      \n\n       {/* body section */}\n        {mainBodies.map( (MainBody, indx) => )}\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default withFassets({\n  component: MainPage,\n  mapFassetsToProps: {\n    Logo:       'company.logo',    // from our prior example\n\n    mainLinks:  'MainPage.*.link', // find matching\n    mainBodies: 'MainPage.*.body',\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nWhen withFassets() encounters wildcards (*), it merely\naccumulates all matching definitions, and promotes them as arrays.\nOur MainPage component no longer explicitly reasons about each\ninjection.\nSideBar: Notice that our mapping process used the array index\nfor our React key.  This technique actually works in a majority of\ncases, because the set of fassets \"in use\" typically does not\nchange.  With that said, there is an alternate approach (using the\n@withKeys directive) that injects the unique fassetsKey into the\nmix.  Please refer to: React Keys (in array processing).\nThrough this implementation, any feature may dynamically inject\nitself in the process autonomously!  In addition, this dynamic\nimplicitly handles the case where a feature is dynamically disabled\n(very kool indeed)!!\nWildcard Processing\nThis section provides additional detail related to wildcard\nprocessing.  For the examples below, please assume the following\nresource definitions:\nfassetsKey             Resource\n=====================  ========\n'company.logo'            1\n'MainPage.cart.link'      2\n'MainPage.cart.body'      3\n'MainPage.search.link'    4\n'MainPage.search.body'    5\n'my.fun.object'           6 ... { greet: 'hello' }\nWildcard Characters:\nCurrently, only one wildcard character is supported:\n\n*: Matches zero or more characters.  Can also span multiple nodes\n(i.e. the dots . of a federated namespace).\nExamples:\nfassetsKey             Matches\n=====================  =============\n'company.logo'         1\n'*link'                [  2,  4    ]\n'MainPage.*.link'      [  2,  4    ]\n'MainPage.*.body'      [    3,  5  ]\n'MainPage.*'           [  2,3,4,5  ]\n'*a*'                  [1,2,3,4,5  ]\n'*'                    [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n'ouch'                 undefined\n'WowZee*WooWoo'        []\n\n\nWildcard Matching:\nThe following pattern matching rules are in effect:\n\nPattern matching is case-sensitive.  It is worth noting that\nfassetsKey definitions are also case-sensitive.\nExamples:\nfassetsKey             Matches\n=====================  ===========\n'MainPage.*.link'      [2,4]\n'mainPage.*.link'      []\n\nBy default, the entire entry is matched. In other words an\nimplicit start/end anchor is applied.  This heuristic can be\naltered by simply injecting wildcards at the start/end of your\nexpression.\nExamples:\nfassetsKey             Matches\n=====================  ===========\n'Page.*.link'          []\n'*Page.*.link'         [2,4]\n\nMatches are restricted to the actual fassetKeys registered through\nthe fassets aspect define/defineUse directives.  In\nother words, the matching algorithm will not drill into the\nresource itself (assuming it is an object with depth).\nExamples:\nfassetsKey             Matches\n=====================  ==========================\n'my.*.object'          [6] ... { greet: 'hello' }\n'my.*.object.greet'    []\n\n\nResource Order (in wildcard processing)\nThe order in which resources are promoted when wildcards are in use,\nis feature expansion order.  In other words, the same order that\nfeatures are registered.\nReact Keys (in array processing)\nAs you probably already know, React requires a key attribute when\ninjecting elements of an array.\nYou may have noticed (in the wildcard example - above), we are using\narray indices for our keys.  In some cases this may be considered an\nanti-pattern, leading to inefficiencies in DOM reconciliation. It\nreally depends on the mutability status of the array. Remember, the\nkey must only be unique among its siblings - not globally (please\nrefer to the React docs\nhere).\nIn the case of fasset usage, key indices will in fact work in most\ncases - assuming there is no variability in the promoted set of\nfasset resources (a normal case).\nIf however there is some conditional logic involved, you may request\nwithFassets() to supply a [fassetsKey, resource] pair, by\nusing the @withKeys suffix.  This is an ideal solution because\nfeature-u guarantees fassetsKey to be unique.\n// mapping snippet ...\n   mainLinks:  'MainPage.*.link@withKeys', // @withKeys: request [fassetsKey, resource] pairs\n                // mainLinks:  [['MainPage.cart.link',   cartLinkResource],\n                //              ['MainPage.search.link', searchLinkResource]],\n\n// array injection snippet ...\n   {mainLinks.map( ([fassetsKey, MainLink]) => )}\n\nResource Validation\nResource validations can optionally be specified through the\nfassets aspect use directive.  This includes:\n\noptionality (required/optional) \nand data type/content\n\nBy default, the use directive simply accepts an array of strings\n(the resources keys which will be used).  This represents resources\nthat are required of type any.  You can change this default by\nreplacing each string with a two element array containing the resource\nkey followed by an options object:\n[ '$fassetsKey', {           // resource key with options object\n  required:   true/false,    // DEFAULT: true\n  type:       $validationFn, // DEFAULT: any\n}]\n\n\nRequired items disallow the undefined value.\n\nType/content validation is specified through a function reference.\nYou may define your own validations, or use one of the canned\nvalidators provided by feature-u.  Please refer to\nfassetValidations for a list of the pre-defined\nvalidators, as well as the validation API.\n\n\nHere is an example that employs validations.  Notice the mix of both\nstrings (with their default semantics), and the options object\n(specifying the validation constraints):\ncreateFeature({\n  fassets: {\n    use: [\n       'MainPage.*.link', // DEFAULT: required of type any\n      ['MainPage.*.body', {required: false, type: fassetValidations.comp}],\n    ],\n  },\n});\n\nDoes Feature Exist\nThe Fassets object can be used to determine if a feature\nis present or not.  If a feature does not exist, or has been disabled,\nthe Fassets.hasFeature() will return false.\n\nIt could be that featureA will conditionally use featureB if it\nis present.\nif (fassets.hasFeature('featureB') {\n  ... do something featureB related\n}\n\n\nIt could be that featureC unconditionally requires that featureD\nis present.  This can be checked in the appWillStart()\nApplication Life Cycle Hook.\nappWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n  assert(fassets.hasFeature('featureD'), '***ERROR*** I NEED featureD');\n}\n\n\n\nNOTE: In addition to fassets.hasFeature(featureName) it is also\npossible to reason over the existence of well-known fasset resources\nthat are specific to a feature.\nfassets recap: Push or Pull\nAt this point, it may be useful to summarize the three\nfassets aspect directives: define, use, and\ndefineUse ... highlighting two broad use cases.\nAs it turns out, when it comes to the definition and consumption of\nfasset resources (covered in the prior sections), there are two\nbroad philosophies: push or pull.\n\nPush - \"throw it over the wall\" \n\nDefinition:\nWhen defining resources in a push philosophy the define\ndirective is crucial.  Here the supplier is simply publicly promoting\na resource for other features to use (take it or leave it).  The\nsupplier is merely saying: \"this is my Public Face\".\n\nConsumption:\nNormally, in a push philosophy, the consumer simply accesses\nthe resource without any use directive (through\nFassets object or withFassets() HoC).\nOptionally however, the consumer may employ the use directive.\nHere they are simply providing feature-u with more information,\nso the system will fail fast (at startup time) when the resource\nis not defined.  In other words, there would never be a need for the\nconsumer to check if the resource is defined (assuming the use\ncontract is \"required\").  Rather, that constraint is achieved by\nfeature-u.  Note: This scenario highlights that multiple\nfeatures can specify the same use directive, providing their\nResource Validation does not conflict.\n\n\n\nPull ... \"a resource contract\" \n\nConsumption:\nWhen using a pull philosophy, the use directive is more\ncritical.  In this case the consumer is saying: \"I plan to use this\nresource from whatever feature(s) wish to supply it\".  This is the\nfirst half of a Resource Contract!\nTypically a use contract is made with wildcards, although not\nrequired.  Wildcards allow external features to inject their\ncontent autonomously.\nSideBar: It is important that the consumer fulfill this\ncontract by programmatically accessing the resource defined in it's\nuse contract (through Fassets object or\nwithFassets() HoC).  This is outside the control of\nfeature-u.\n\nDefinition:\nWhen defining a resource in the pull philosophy, the supplier\nshould use the defineUse directive (even though a define\nwould technically work).  Here the supplier is saying \"I am\nsupplying this resource under contract\".  In this case the system\nwill fail fast (at startup time) if there is NO fulfillment of\nthis contract (for example a typo).\n\n\n\n\nObtaining fassets object\nBroadly speaking, Public Facing fasset resources can be obtained\neither by:\n\nusing the withFassets() HoC (for UI Components),\n\nor by directly referencing the Fassets object\nprogrammatically.\n\n\nThe former, implicitly accesses fassets (under the covers) using a\nreact context.  The latter requires direct programmatic\naccess to the Fassets object ... of which there are four\nways to achieve:\n\nUse the fassets parameter supplied through\nfeature-u's programmatic APIs ... for code that is under the\ncontrol of feature-u (for example, life-cycle hooks, or logic\nhooks, etc.).\n\nInject fassets comp props ... for react\ncomponents (using the special withFassets() '.'\nkeyword, injecting the fassets object itself).\n\nUse Managed Code Expansion ... for\nAspectContent definitions requiring fassets during\ninline code-expansion (employing the\nexpandWithFassets() wrapper function).\n\nimport fassets from your application\nmainline ... for code that is outside the control of feature-u\n(providing the reference is not needed during inline\ncode-expansion).\n\n\nYou may be asking yourself: \"Why so many techniques\"?  Let's\ndelve into this just a bit ...\nGenerally speaking, programmatic access to the\nFassets object is complicated by whether it is needed\nduring inline code-expansion or not.\n\nThe fact that launchApp() accumulates fasset resources,\nmeans that it must run to completion before fassets is made\navailable through an import.\n\nFurthermore, the goal of restricting cross-feature imports requires\nthat the fassets object be used in place of imports.\n\n\nIn spite of these seemingly conflicting artifacts, the goal of\nrestricting cross-feature imports is most certainly a worthy\nobjective! The bottom line is that\nManaged Code Expansion comes to the rescue, and\n\"fills the gap\" when needed.\nAccessing external feature resources in a seamless way is a\nrudimentary benefit of feature-u that alleviates a number of\nproblems in your code, making your features truly plug-and-play.\nSideBar: It is possible that a module may be using more than one of\nthese access techniques.  As an example a logic module may have to use\nexpandWithFassets() to access fassets at code-expansion\ntime, but is also supplied fassets as a parameter in it's functional\nhook.  This is perfectly fine, as they will be referencing the exact\nsame fassets object instance.\nLet's take a closer look at each of these access points.\n\nfassets parameter\nThe simplest way to access the Fassets object is through\nthe programmatic APIs of feature-u, where fassets is supplied as\na parameter.  This covers any process that is under the control of\nfeature-u, for example:\n\napp life-cycle hooks:\n\nappWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}): rootAppElm | falsy\nappDidStart({fassets, [appState], [dispatch]}): void\n\n\n\n\nroute hooks (PKG: feature-router):\nrouteCB({fassets, appState}): rendered-component (null for none)\n\n\nlogic hooks (PKG: redux-logic):\ncreateLogic({\n  ...\n  transform({getState, action, fassets}, next) {\n    ...\n  },\n  process({getState, action, fassets}, dispatch, done) {\n    ...\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nInject fassets comp props\nFor react components, you can inject the Fassets object\ndirectly in your component properties by using the special\nwithFassets() '.' keyword.  This emits the fassets\nobject itself (in the same tradition as \"current directory\").\nWhen using the withFassets() HoC you have a choice ... you\ncan inject selected assets as needed, or the the entire fassets\nobject, or both ... it's really a personal preference.\nAs it turns out, this can even be used to introduce fassets into\nother HoCs, such as redux connect() using it's ownProps parameter.\nHere is an example:\nconst MyComp = ({fassets, Logo, eggCount}) => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      My egg total: {eggCount}\n    \n    ... can use fassets here too (if desired)\n  );\n};\n\nconst MyConnectedComp = connect( // standard redux connect\n (state, {fassets}) => ({ // ... fassets available in ownProps (via withFassets() below)\n   eggCount: fassets.selectors.getEggCount(state), // ... uses external feature selector (via fassets)\n }),\n)(MyComp);\n\nexport default withFassets({\n  mapFassetsToProps: {\n    fassets: '.', // ... introduce fassets into props via the '.' keyword\n    Logo:    'company.logo',\n  }\n})(MyConnectedComp);\n\nIf you are of a \"functional\" mindset, here is the same example using\nfunctional composition:\nimport {compose} from 'redux';\n\nconst MyComp = ({fassets, Logo, eggCount}) => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n      My egg total: {eggCount}\n    \n    ... can use fassets here too (if desired)\n  );\n};\n\nexport default compose( // combine withFassets() and redux connect() using functional composition\n  withFassets({\n    mapFassetsToProps: {\n      fassets: '.', // ... introduce fassets into props via the '.' keyword\n      Logo:    'company.logo',\n    },\n  }),\n  connect((state, {fassets}) => ({ // ... fassets available in ownProps (via withFassets())\n    eggCount: fassets.selectors.getEggCount(state), // ... uses external feature selector (via fassets)\n  })),\n)(MyComp);\n\n\nManaged Code Expansion\nTo obtain early access to the Fassets object (during\ninline code-expansion), simply wrap your AspectContent\nin the expandWithFassets() utility.\nThere are two situations that make accessing fassets problematic,\nwhich are: a: in-line code expansion (where fassets may not\nbe fully defined), and b: order dependencies (across\nfeatures).\nTo illustrate this, the following redux-logic module is\nmonitoring an action defined by an external feature (see *1*).\nBecause this fassets reference is made during code expansion time, the\nimport will not work, because the fassets object has not yet been fully\ndefined.  This is a timing issue.\nimport fassets from '~/app'; // *1*\n\nexport const myLogicModule = createLogic({\n\n  name: 'myLogicModule',\n  type: String(fassets.featureB.actions.fooBar), // *1* fassets NOT defined during in-line expansion\n\n  process({getState, action}, dispatch, done) {\n    ... \n  },\n\n});\n\nWhen AspectContent definitions require the\nFassets object at code expansion time, you can wrap the\ndefinition in a expandWithFassets() function.  In other\nwords, your aspect content can either be the actual content itself\n(ex: a reducer), or a function that returns the content.\nYour callback function should conform to the following signature:\nAPI: expandWithFassetsCB(fassets): AspectContent\nWhen this is done, feature-u will invoke the\nexpandWithFassetsCB() in a controlled way, passing the fully\nresolved Fassets object as a parameter.\nTo accomplish this, you must wrap your expansion function with the the\nexpandWithFassets() utility.  The reason for this is that\nfeature-u must be able to distinguish a\nexpandWithFassetsCB() function from other functions (ex:\nreducers).\nHere is the same example (from above) that that fixes our\nproblem by replacing the fassets import with expandWithFassets():\n                             // *1* we replace fassets import with expandWithFassets()\nexport const myLogicModule = expandWithFassets( (fassets) => createLogic({\n\n  name: 'myLogicModule',\n  type: String(fassets.featureB.actions.fooBar), // *1* fassets now is fully defined\n\n  process({getState, action}, dispatch, done) {\n    ... \n  },\n\n}) );\n\nBecause expandWithFassetsCB() is invoked in a controlled way\n(by feature-u), the supplied fassets parameter is guaranteed to be\ndefined (issue a).  Not only that, but the supplied fassets object\nis guaranteed to have all public facing feature definitions resolved\n(issue b).\nSideBar: A secondary reason expandWithFassets() may be\nused (over and above fassets injection during code expansion) is to\ndelay code expansion, which can avoid issues related to\n(legitimate but somewhat obscure) circular dependencies.\n\nimport fassets\nFor run-time functions that are outside the control of feature-u,\nsimply import fassets from your application mainline.\nYour mainline exports the launchApp() return value\n... which is the Fassets object.\nsrc/app.js\n// launch our app, exposing the feature-u Fassets object (facilitating cross-feature communication)!\nexport default launchApp({\n  ...\n});\n\nWhile imports are a simple and straight forward process, they cannot be\nused when the reference is needed during inline code-expansion\n(because launchApp() must run to completion).\n\nAs it turns out, importing fassets is not usually necessary, because\nmost cases are covered through the alternate means.\nFor sake of example, let's consider a somewhat contrived example,\nwhere a piece of code needs to close the leftNav menu.  This function\nis provided by a Public Facing resource defined in the leftNav\nfeature.\nimport fassets from '../app';\n\nfunction closeSideBar() {\n  fassets.leftNav.close();\n}\n\n"},"featureRouter.html":{"url":"featureRouter.html","title":"Feature Based Routes","keywords":"","body":"Feature Based Routes\nOnce your application grows to more than a few pages, the need for a\nrouting solution becomes critical.  Which one do you use?  There are\nso many!\nTrue to feature-u's ideology, no one routing solution is mandated.\nYou are free to pick and choose whichever of the many solutions meet\nyour needs.\nWith the advent of feature-u's V1 approach to\nCross Feature Communication, it is now possible to integrate to a number\nof the routing solutions available today out-of-the-box!\nBy using a pull philosophy in accumulating\nresources over your features, you can easily gather a collection of\nlinks for your menus and the route components themselves.  This\nsolution employs Resource Contracts and\nWildcard Processing through the\nFassets.get() and withFassets() access points.\nUsing this technique, you can accumulate your routing resources\nautonomously, allowing your app to grow feature by feature, not\nneeding to know everything in advance.  All that is needed is to adopt\na naming convention (publicly promoted through the\nfassets aspect use directive - a\nResource Contract) for your links and route\ncomponents.\nSideBar: While your routing solution may involve a feature-u\nplugin (Extendable aspects), for the most part\nfeature-u's Cross Feature Communication should go a long way in\nsupport of router integration out-of-the-box.\nThis section will briefly look at how feature-u projects can\nintegrate with two different routing solutions (the \"tried and true\"\nreact-router, and a \"new approach\" based\non state: feature-router).\nreact-router\nreact-router V4 makes it very simple to perform\nrouting. By injecting a  component at the root of your\napplication, your  components can can live anywhere in the\ntree. In turn,  components make it easy to navigate to the\nvarious routes.\nIn this example, we employ an app feature that has two\nresponsibilities:\n\npromote our top-level  component, and\nmanage our application routes.\n\nLet's walk through this implementation, step by step ...\nStep One (basic  injection):\nThe first goal of our app feature is to promote the top-level\n component.  This is easily accomplished by using\nfeature-u's Application Life Cycle Hooks.\nHere are the code snippets that implement this first goal.\nfeatures/app/featureName.js see: Best Practices Feature Name\n/**\n * Expose our featureName through a mini-meta module that is\n * \"importable\" in all use-cases (a single-source-of-truth).\n */\nexport default 'app';\n\nfeatures/app/comp/App.js our top-level  component\nimport React from 'react';\n\n/**\n * Our top-level App component (just a start).\n */\nexport default App = () => Hello World;\n\nNow we simply promote the  component into the DOM using our\nFeature.appWillStart() Application Life Cycle Hook.\nfeatures/app/index.js our app Feature, promoting the  component\nimport React           from 'react';\nimport {createFeature} from 'feature-u';\nimport App             from './comp/App;\nimport featureName     from './featureName';\n\nexport default createFeature({\n\n  name: featureName,\n\n  appWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n    // insure we don't clobber any supplied content\n    if (curRootAppElm) {\n      const msg = \"***ERROR***  does NOT support children \" +\n                  \"but another feature/aspect is attempting to inject it's content. \" +\n                  \"Please resolve either by adjusting the feature expansion order, \" +\n                  \"or promoting  through the conflicting artifact.\";\n      console.log(`${msg} ... conflicting artifact:`, curRootAppElm);\n      throw new Error(msg);\n    }\n    return ;\n  }\n});\n\nStep Two (adding links and routes):\nThe second goal of our app feature is to manage our application\nlinks and routes.\nOur app feature accomplishes this by introducing a\nResource Contract, where we pull in links and\nroutes under the following naming convention:\n\n*.link.comp - any fasset resource suffixed with .link.comp is\nexpected to be a  component, and will be displayed in the\nApp header menu.\n\n*.route.comp - any fasset resource suffixed with .route.comp is\nexpected to be a  component, which will be rendered when\nthe application navigates to a matching route.\n\n\nHere is our app feature with it's newly enhanced usage contract (see\nuse directive):\nfeatures/app/index.js our app Feature, enhanced with the new usage contract\nimport React           from 'react';\nimport {createFeature} from 'feature-u';\nimport App             from './comp/App;\nimport featureName     from './featureName';\n\nexport default createFeature({\n\n  name: featureName,\n\n  fassets: {          // NEW:\n    use: [            // our usage contract\n      '*.link.comp',  // ... link components\n      '*.route.comp'  // ... route components\n    ]\n  },\n\n  appWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n    // insure we don't clobber any supplied content\n    if (curRootAppElm) {\n      const msg = \"***ERROR***  does NOT support children \" +\n                  \"but another feature/aspect is attempting to inject it's content. \" +\n                  \"Please resolve either by adjusting the feature expansion order, \" +\n                  \"or promoting  through the conflicting artifact.\";\n      console.log(`${msg} ... conflicting artifact:`, curRootAppElm);\n      throw new Error(msg);\n    }\n    return ;\n  }\n});\n\nAnd here is the fulfillment of our contract ... the enhanced \ncomponent (with links and routes).\nfeatures/app/comp/App.js our top-level  component with links and routes\nimport React           from 'react';\nimport {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';\n\n/**\n * Our top-level App component (with links and routes)!\n */\nconst App = ({linkComps, routeComps}) => (\n  \n    \n      \n        My App\n        { linkComps.map( (LinkComp, indx) => ) }\n      \n      \n        { routeComps.map( (RouteComp, indx) => ) }\n      \n    \n  \n);\n\nexport default withFassets({\n  component: App,\n  mapFassetsToProps: {\n    linkComps:  '*.link.comp',\n    routeComps: '*.route.comp'\n  }\n});\n\nNotice that in support of react-router, we wrap everything\nwith .\nAlso notice that we inject the needed fasset resources using the\nwithFassets() HoC.\nBecause our mapping uses wildcards, many resources will match\n(accumulated into arrays).  We simply inject the resources into our\ncomponent using array iteration.\nSideBar: In regard to the react key using an array indices, please\n see: React Keys (in array processing).\nSuppliers (supplying content to the resource contract)\nBy employing wildcards, these links and routes can be supplied by\nany of our features - autonomously!!\nThe order in which these resources appear (when using wildcards) are\nfeature expansion order (i.e. the same order that features are\nregistered).\nHere is a foo feature that supplies it's own link and route\ncomponents.\nfeatures/foo/index.js a foo feature supplying links and routes\nimport React           from 'react';\nimport {createFeature} from 'feature-u';\nimport {Link, Route}   from 'react-router-dom';\nimport featureName     from './featureName'; // 'foo' ... a single-source-of-truth mini-meta module\n\nconst featureURLPath = `/${featureName}`; // the URL path is /foo\n\nconst link      = () => Foo;\nconst component = () =>  Foo }/>;\n\nexport default createFeature({\n  name: featureName,\n\n  fassets: {\n    defineUse: { // KEY: supply content under contract of the app feature\n      [`${featureName}.link.comp`]:  link,\n      [`${featureName}.route.comp`]: component\n    }\n  }\n\n});\n\nNotice that we are using the defineUse directive (even though a\ndefine would technically work).  This indicates that we are\nsupplying this resource \"under contract\" (i.e. it should match a\ncorresponding use directive).  This allows feature-u to fail\nfast if there is a problem (for example a misspelling).\nSumming it up:\nThat's all there is to it. As we add features with links and route\ncomponents, they are automatically picked up and rendered to our\napp!!\nfeature-u's wildcard support makes it easy to support most any\nuse case you might need.  It is nice that we don't have to keep\nmodifying  when we want to add a new menu link or another\nroute. Just by adhering to our naming convention they are\nautomatically pulled in and used.\nfeature-router\nfeature-router (a feature-u plugin, packaged\nseparately) represents a new twist on routing.\nFeature Routes are based on a very simple concept: allow the\napplication state to drive the routes!\nIt operates through a series of feature-based routing functions that\nreason about the appState, and either return a rendered component, or\nnull to allow downstream routes the same opportunity.  Basically the\nfirst non-null return wins.\nIn feature based routing, you will not find the typical \"route path to\ncomponent\" mapping catalog, where (for example) some pseudo\nroute('signIn') directive causes the SignIn screen to display\n(which in turn causes the system to accommodate the request by\nadjusting it's state).\nIn other words, you will never see application logic that re-routes to\na signIn screen after checking to see if the user is authenticated.\nRather, the appState is king!  If the user is NOT authenticated\n(based on the route's analysis of the appState) the SignIn screen is\nautomatically displayed ... Easy Peasy!\nDepending on your perspective, this approach can be more robust and\nnatural.\nWant to see an example?  Because feature-router was\nbuilt as a feature-u plugin, you can find examples directly in\nit's documentation.\nPlease Note that it is possible to use feature-router\nin conjunction with other routing solutions!\nSideBar: Another characteristic of this routing plugin is it\nallows features to promote their own screens in an encapsulated and\nautonomous way!  As we have seen, this goal can also be accomplished\nthrough feature-u's V1 approach to Cross Feature Communication\nThis discussion is obviously an introduction.  There is more to this\nplugin that we haven't touched on.

It's just as though disabled features never\nexisted (logically).\nTo fully understand how this works, consider the following\ncharacteristics of a disabled feature (read this table like a\nsentence ... injecting the header in front of each column):\n\n\n\ndisabled features with ...\nnever registers the feature's ...\ntherefore, the feature's:\n\n\n\n\nlife cycle hooks\ncallbacks\ninitialization code never executes\n\n\nfassets\nPublic Face\nPublic Face doesn't exist\n\n\nstate management\nreducers\nstate doesn't exist\n\n\nlogic\nlogic modules\nlogic is never executed\n\n\nfeature routes\nroutes\nscreens are never presented\n\n\netc.\netc.\netc.\n\n\n\nThe internal implementation of Feature Enablement is extremely\nstraightforward!

You can also use it to determine whether a\nfeature is present ... through it's Fassets.hasFeature()\nmethod.\n\nIt could be that featureA will conditionally use featureB if it\nis present.\nif (fassets.hasFeature('featureB') {\n  ... do something featureB related\n}\n\n\nIt could be that featureC unconditionally requires that featureD\nbe present.

In doing this, a single line\nmodification can propagate to many areas of your implementation.\nThis discussion is a guideline.  It's up to you to implement these\nitems because feature-u is not in control of this.\nAvoid Cross Feature Imports\nA best practice is to treat each of your features as isolated\nimplementations.\nAs a result, a given feature should never directly import\nresources from other features.  This is tempting because typically the\ncode is right there!\nIf one feature requires resources from other features, simply use the\nCross Feature Communication mechanism provided by feature-u (exposing\na smaller cross section of the Feature's Public Face).\nThere are a number of reasons for this:\n\nYour features truly become plug-and-play!  This is probably\nthe most compelling argument, and has many ramifications.\n\nIt is more controlled. By formally declaring Public Interface\npoints, this facilitates collaboration between features (and even\na better understanding between developers).\n\nWhen a feature is disabled, it is dynamically removed from the\nmix.  In many cases, this dynamic is automatically reflected\n(for example, when it is pulled in through\nWildcards).  Even when it is not\nautomatic, there is a built-in mechanism by which your logic can\nreason about the existence of a feature\n(i.e. Fassets.hasFeature()).\n\nFeatures can be tested in isolation. Simplified or mock\ncomponents can easily be provided to \"stand in\" for any named fassets\nwithout any sophisticated mocking technique.\n\nUpgrading features can be developed on a separate track.  A\n\"new and improved\" feature can co-exist, providing it conforms to\nthe same Public Face of the original.  Then at build or\nrun-time, the upgraded feature can be \"swapped in\" in place of the\noriginal.  This facilitates A/B testing and provides a nice\nmigration path while keeping the original feature fully operational\n(i.e. it can easily be reverted if necessary).\n\n\nFeature Name\nThe featureName is a critical item that can be used throughout your\nfeature implementation to promote a consistent feature identity.\nA key aspect of the featureName is that feature-u guarantees it's\nuniqueness.  As a result, it can be used to qualify the identity of\nseveral feature aspects.  For example:\n\nprefix action types with featureName, guaranteeing their uniqueness app-wide\n(see: feature-redux docs)\n\nprefix logic module names with featureName, identifying where that module lives\n(see: feature-redux-logic docs)\n\ndepending on the context, the featureName can be used as the root of your feature state's shape\n(see: feature-redux docs)\n\n\nWhile Feature.name is part of the Feature object\n(emitted from createFeature(), there are race conditions\nwhere the Feature object will not be defined during\nin-line code expansion.\nAs a result, a best practice is to expose a featureName constant,\nthrough a featureName.js mini-meta module that is \"importable\" in\nall use-cases (i.e. a single-source-of-truth).\nsrc/feature/foo/featureName.js\n/**\n * Expose our featureName through a mini-meta module that is\n * \"importable\" in all use-cases (a single-source-of-truth).\n */\nexport default 'foo';\n\nFeature State Location\nBecause feature-u relies on\nslicedReducer()\n(in the feature-redux package), a best practice is to use\nthe reducer's embellished selector to qualify your feature state root\nin all your selector definitions.

This is especially true\nwhen multiple resources are returned (using wildcards).  As\nan example, JSX requires unique keys for array injections (the\nfassetsKey is a prime candidate for this, since it is\nguaranteed to be unique).\nTo accomplish this, simply suffix the fassetsKey with the\nkeyword: '@withKeys'.

This is\nuseful if you wish to inject fassets into downstream processes\n(such as redux connect() via it's ownProps).\nWildcards\nWildcards (*) are supported in the\nfassetsKey, accumulating multiple resources (a resource array),\nmatching the supplied pattern:\n\nwithout wildcards, a single resource is injected\n(undefined for none).\n\nwith wildcards, a resource array is injected, in order of\nfeature expansion (empty array for none).\n\n\nExample ...\nmapFassetsToProps: {\n  Logo:       'company.logo',\n              // Logo:  companyLogoResource,\n\n              // NOTE: wildcard usage ...\n  mainLinks:  'MainPage.*.link',\n              // mainLinks:  [cartLinkResource, searchLinkResource],\n  mainBodies: 'MainPage.*.body'\n              // mainBodies: [cartBodyResource, searchBodyResource],\n}\n\n@withKeys\nIn some cases, you may wish to know the corresponding\nfassetsKey of the returned resource.  This is especially true\nwhen multiple resources are returned (using wildcards).\nAs an example, React requires a key attribute for array\ninjections (the fassetsKey is a prime candidate for this, since\nit is guaranteed to be unique).\nTo accomplish this, simply suffix the fassetsKey with the\nkeyword: '@withKeys'.  When this is encountered, the resource\nreturned is a two-element array: [fassetsKey, resource].\nExample ...\nmapFassetsToProps: {\n  Logo:       'company.logo',\n              // Logo:  companyLogoResource,\n\n  mainLinks:  'MainPage.*.link@withKeys', // NOTE: @withKeys directive\n              // mainLinks:  [['MainPage.cart.link',   cartLinkResource],\n              //              ['MainPage.search.link', searchLinkResource]],\n  mainBodies: 'MainPage.*.body'\n              // mainBodies: [cartBodyResource, searchBodyResource],\n}\n\nThis topic is discussed in more detail in: React Keys (in array processing).\n\n\n\n  mapFassetsToPropsFn â‡’ mapFassetsToPropsStruct\nA function (used by withFassets()) that returns a\nmapFassetsToPropsStruct, defining a prop/fassetsKey\nmapping, from which fasset resources are injected into a Component.\n\n  \n    \n      ParamTypeDescription\n    \n  \n  \n\n    ownPropsobjthe outlying properties supplied to the\nconnected component.\n\n      \n\n\nReturns: mapFassetsToPropsStruct - the structure defining a\nprop/fassetsKey mapping, from which fasset resources are injected\ninto a Component.  \n\n\n\n  Aspect : Object\nAspect objects (emitted from createAspect()) are used to\nextend feature-u.\nThe Aspect object promotes a series of life-cycle methods that\nfeature-u invokes in a controlled way.

It operates in an open plugable\narchitecture where Extendable Aspects integrate feature-u to other\nframeworks, matching your specific run-time stack.  This is good,\nbecause not everyone uses the same frameworks!\n\nYou want state management using redux?  There is an\nAspect for that: feature-redux.\n\nYou want to maintain your logic using redux-logic?\nThere is an Aspect for that: feature-redux-logic.\n\nYou want your features to autonomously promote their screens within\nthe application?

For extra credit,\nyou should consider publishing your package, so other XYZ users can\nbenefit from your work!\n\n\nIt is important to understand that feature-u does not alter the\ninterface to these frameworks in any way.  You use them the same way\nyou always have.  feature-u merely provides a well defined\norganizational layer, where the frameworks are automatically\nsetup and configured by accumulating the necessary resources across all\nyour features.\nLocating Extensions\nTo locate the latest set of published feature-u extensions, simply\nsearch the npm registry using a 'feature-u' keyword.  All\npackages that extend feature-u should include this keyword in\ntheir package.\nDuring feature-u's initial release (3/2018), I published the three\nAspects mentioned above (matching my preferred stack), so at that\ntime there were three plugins.  Assuming feature-u gains momentum,\nthe hope is that other authors will contribute their work.\nIf you create your own extension and decide to publish it, don't\nforget to include the 'feature-u' keyword in your package, so\nothers can easily locate your extension.\nAspect Object (extending feature-u)\nTo extend feature-u, you merely define and promote an\nAspect object (using createAspect()).\nThe Aspect object promotes a series of life-cycle methods\nthat feature-u invokes in a controlled way.  This life-cycle is\ncontrolled by launchApp() ... it is supplied the Aspects,\nand it invokes their methods.\nThe essential characteristics of the Aspect life-cycle is\nto:\n\naccumulate AspectContent across all features\nperform the desired setup and configuration\nexpose the framework in some way (by injecting a component in the\nroot DOM, or some Aspect Cross Communication\nmechanism)\n\nFor complete details, please refer to the section on\nAspect Life Cycle Methods.\nDefining rootAppElm\nIn feature-u the rootAppElm is the top-level react DOM that\nrepresents the display of the entire application.\nThis is a non-changing omnipresent DOM that achieves it's dynamics\nthrough a series of both framework components and application injected\nutilities.  As an example, a typical rootAppElm may contain:\n\na navigational component providing screen dynamics (through an Aspect Framework injection)\na state promotional component making state available to subordinates (through an Aspect Framework injection)\na notification utility (through an application Feature injection)\na left-nav menu (through an application Feature injection)\netc. etc. etc.\n\nThe rootAppElm is defined through a progressive accumulation of DOM\ninjections, using a combination of both Aspects and\nFeatures.\nThere are three API's involved and they all accept a curRootAppElm\nparameter, and return a new rootAppElm that includes the supplied\nelement, accommodating the accumulative process.\nThe three API's are listed here, and are executed in this order.\nThey include life-cycle-hooks that are defined from both\nAspects and Features.\n\nAspect.initialRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\nFeature.appWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}): rootAppElm | falsy\nAspect.injectRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\n\nIt is important to understand that the Feature hook is\nsandwiched between the two Aspect hooks.  Without this\ninsight, you would most certainly wonder what the difference was\nbetween the two Aspect hooks.\nA null rootAppElm seeds the entire process.  The first hook is used\nby any Aspect that wishes to inject itself before all others ... and\nso on.  The end result is a DOM hierarchy where the first injected\nelement is manifest at the bottom of the hierarchy, and the last\ninjection ends up on top.\nTo put this in perspective, let's analyze an example where we are\nusing two Aspects (feature-redux, and\nfeature-router), and an application Feature that manages a\nleft-nav menu available throughout the application.\n\nThe Aspect for feature-router (routeAspect) injects a\n component that (by design) can have no other\nchildren.  Therefore it uses the first api:\nrouteAspect: Aspect.initialRootAppElm()\nfunction initialRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm) {\n  // insure we don't clobber any supplied content\n  // ... by design,  doesn't support children\n  if (curRootAppElm) {\n    throw new Error('*** ERROR*** Please register routeAspect (from feature-router) before other Aspects ' +\n                    'that inject content in the rootAppElm ...  does NOT support children.');\n  }\n\n  // seed the rootAppElm with our StateRouter\n  return ;\n}\n\n\nThe leftNav application feature, injects it's Drawer/SideBar\ncomponent through the second API (the only one available to\nFeatures):\nleftNav: Feature.appWillStart()\nfunction appWillStart({fassets, curRootAppElm}) {\n  return (\n     registerDrawer(ref) }\n            content={}\n            onClose={closeSideBar}>\n      {curRootAppElm}\n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nThe Aspect for feature-redux (reducerAspect) injects the redux\n component that must encompass all other components\n(i.e. be on top). Therefore it uses the third API:\nreducerAspect: Aspect.injectRootAppElm()\nfunction injectRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm) {\n  return (\n    \n      {curRootAppElm}\n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nLast but not least, feature-u renders\n at the root of the application DOM (in\nsupport of Cross Feature Communication and the withFassets()\nHoC).\nThis is conditionally performed only when a rootAppElm has been\ndefined.  Otherwise, the App is responsible for this in the\nregisterRootAppElm() hook.\nif (rootAppElm) {\n  rootAppElm = {rootAppElm};\n}\n\n\n\nThe end result of this example generates the following DOM:\n\n  \n     registerDrawer(ref) }\n            content={}\n            onClose={closeSideBar}>\n      \n    \n  \n\nAspect Cross Communication\nSome Aspects will rely on an Aspect Cross Communication mechanism\nto accomplish their work (not to be confused with\nCross Feature Communication).\nAspect Cross Communication is where an Aspect requires\nadditional information (over and above it's\nAspectContent) either from other Aspects or\nFeatures.  Therefore the extending Aspect must define\n(and use) additional Aspect/Feature APIs.\nAs an example of this, consider the feature-redux plugin.\nBecause it manages redux, it also maintains the\nredux middleware.  As a result, it must provide a way for\nother Aspects to inject their middleware.  It accomplishes this by\nexposing a new Aspect API: Aspect.getReduxMiddleware().\n\nAn extending Aspect that introduces a new API should do the\nfollowing:\n\nDocument the API, so the external client knows how to use it.\n\nRegister the API, allowing it to pass feature-u validation.\nDepending on whether this is an API for a Aspect or\nFeature, use one of the following:\n\nAPI: extendAspectProperty(name, owner): void\nAPI: extendFeatureProperty(name, owner): void\n\nThis registration allows the new API (i.e. the name parameter)\nto be referenced in either createAspect() or\ncreateFeature() respectively.\nThis registration should occur in the Aspect.genesis()\nlife cycle method (i.e. very early) to guarantee the new API is\navailable during feature-u validation.\nSideBar: feature-u keeps track of the agent that owns\neach extension through the owner parameter.  Use any string that\nuniquely identifies your utility (such as the aspect's npm\npackage name).  This prevents exceptions when duplicate\nextension requests are made by the same owner.  This can happen\nwhen multiple instances of an aspect type are supported, and also\nin unit testing.\n\nUtilize the API in one of the\nAspect Life Cycle Methods to gather the\nadditional information (from other Aspects or\nFeatures).\n\n\n\nExample: \nAs a concrete example of this, let's look at some code snippets\nfrom the aforementioned feature-redux plugin:\n\nHere is how the new API is documented:\nfeature-redux#inputs\n\nMiddleware Integration:\nBecause feature-redux manages redux, other Aspects\ncan promote their redux middleware through\nfeature-redux's Aspect.getReduxMiddleware() API (an\nAspect Cross Communication mechanism).  As\nan example, the feature-redux-logic Aspect integrates\nredux-logic.\n\n\n\nHere is the new API registration:\nfeature-redux/src/reducerAspect.js\n/**\n * Register feature-redux proprietary Aspect APIs (required to pass\n * feature-u validation).\n * This must occur early in the life-cycle (i.e. this method) to\n * guarantee the new API is available during feature-u validation.\n */\nfunction genesis() {\n  extendAspectProperty('getReduxStore', 'feature-redux');      // Aspect.getReduxStore(): store\n  extendAspectProperty('getReduxMiddleware', 'feature-redux'); // Aspect.getReduxMiddleware(): reduxMiddleware\n}\n\n\nHere is the new API usage:\nfeature-redux-logic/src/logicAspect.js\n/**\n * Expose our redux middleware that activates redux-logic.  \n *\n * This method is consumed by the feature-redux Aspect using an\n * \"aspect cross-communication\".\n *\n * @private\n */\nfunction getReduxMiddleware() {\n  return this.logicMiddleware;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect Life Cycle Methods\nThe following list represents a complete compilation of all Aspect\nLife Cycle Methods.  Simply follow the link for a thorough\ndiscussion of each:\n\nAspect.name\nAspect.genesis(): string\nAspect.validateFeatureContent(feature): string\nAspect.expandFeatureContent(fassets, feature): string\nAspect.assembleFeatureContent(fassets, activeFeatures): void\nAspect.assembleAspectResources(fassets, aspects): void\nAspect.initialRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\nAspect.injectRootAppElm(fassets, curRootAppElm): rootAppElm\nAspect.config\nAspect.additionalMethods()\n\nNotes of Interest ...\n\nExecution Order: \nThe order in which these methods are presented (above) represent\nthe same order they are executed.\n\n\n\nAspect State Retention: \nIt is common for an Aspect to use more than one of these\nlife cycle methods to do it's work.  When this happens, typically\nthere is a need for state retention (in order to pick up in one\nstep where it left off in another).\nAs an example, an Aspect may:\n\nuse Aspect.assembleFeatureContent() to assemble it's\ncontent across all features ... retaining the content\n\nand then use Aspect.injectRootAppElm() to promote the\ncontent assembled in the prior step\n\n\nThis state retention can be implemented in a number of different\nways, depending on your philosophy and run-time environment.  For\nexample, you could use the module context of an ES6 environment, or\nalternatively the Aspect object instance itself.\nThe latter is available (should you choose to use it) because\nthese hooks are in fact methods of the Aspect object.  In other\nwords, this is bound to the Aspect object instance.  As a\nresult, you are free to use this for your state retention.\n\n\n\nfassets Parameter:\nYou will notice that the fassets parameter is supplied on many of these\nlife cycle methods.  As you know the Fassets object is used\nin promoting Cross Feature Communication.  \nWhile it is most likely an anti-pattern to directly interrogate the\nFassets object within the Aspect, it is frequently required to\n\"pass through\" to downstream processes (as an opaque object).\nThis is the reason the fassets object is supplied!!\nAs examples of this:\n\nThe Feature.logic aspect (feature-redux-logic) will\ndependency inject (DI) the Fassets object into the\nredux-logic process.\n\nThe Feature.route aspect (feature-router)\ncommunicates fassets in it's routing callbacks.\n\netc. etc. etc.\n\n\n\n\nAspect.name\nThe Aspect.name is used to \"key\" AspectContent of this\ntype in the Feature object.  \nFor example: an Aspect.name: 'xyz' would permit a Feature.xyz:\nxyzContent construct.\nAs a result, Aspect names cannot clash with built-in aspects, and\nthey must be unique (across all aspects that are in-use).\nBest Practice ...\nIt is a good practice to allow your Aspect name to be re-configured at\nrun-time because they must be unique, and externally published\nAspects cannot know the Aspect mix that is in-use.  This can be\naccomplished through a defensive Aspect implementation that references\nfeature properties by indexing the Aspect.name rather than hard coding\nit.\nAs an example, the following code snippet assumes a context of an xyz\nAspect method ...\nxyzAspect.someMethod():\n  ...\n  const feature = ...;\n\n  // DO NOT HARD CODE:\n  ... feature.xyz\n\n  // RATHER INDEX:\n  ... feature[this.name]\n\nThis allows your clientele to reset the Aspect.name as follows:\nclient code initialization:\n  xyzAspect.name = 'xyzFoo';\n\nAspect.genesis()\nAPI: genesis(): string\ngenesis() is an optional Life Cycle Hook invoked one\ntime, at the very beginning of the app's start up process.\nThis hook can perform Aspect related initialization and\nvalidation:\n\ninitialization: this is where where proprietary Aspect/Feature\nAPIs should be registered (if any) - via\nextendAspectProperty() and\nextendFeatureProperty() (please see:\nAspect Cross Communication).\n\nvalidation: this is where an aspect can verify it's own required\nconfiguration (if any). Some aspects require certain settings (set\nby the application) in self for them to operate.\n\n\nRETURN: an error message string when self is in an invalid state\n(falsy when valid).

It however provides a\nhook for aspects that need to transfer additional content from the\nexpansion function to the expanded content.  As an example, the\nreducer aspect must transfer the slice property from the expansion\nfunction to the expanded reducer.\nRETURN: an optional error message string when the supplied feature\ncontains invalid content for this aspect (falsy when valid).

This hook is executed after all the\naspects have assembled their feature content (i.e. after\nassembleFeatureContent()).\nThis is an optional second-pass (so-to-speak) of Aspect data\ngathering, that facilitates\nAspect Cross Communication.  It allows an\nextending aspect to gather resources from other aspects, using an\nadditional API (ex: Aspect.getXyz()).\nAs an example of this, consider feature-redux.

Configurations (if any) should be documented by the specific\nAspect, and if required, should be validated in the\nAspect.genesis() hook.\nThe config sub-object is \"open\" in the sense that any content is\nallowed.  In other words there is no need to pre-register acceptable\nproperties on the config sub-object (as there is in direct properties\nof the Aspect object ... i.e. extendAspectProperty()).\nIn addition to configuration, it is common for Aspects to use the\nconfig sub-object for hidden diagnostic purposes (hidden in the\nsense that they are not documented).  These settings are employed\nwhen researching an issue, and typically alter behavior in some way or\nglean additional information.  As such they would only be communicated\nto users on a case-by-case basis.\nAspect.additionalMethods()\nAspects may contain additional \"proprietary\" methods in support of\nAspect Cross Communication ... a contract\nbetween one or more aspects.  This is merely an API specified by one\nAspect, and used by another Aspect,\nfacilitated through the assembleAspectResources(fassets, aspects): void\nhook.\nAs an example of this, consider feature-redux.

How do you encapsulate your features while\npulling them back together so they operate as one application?\nThis list (below) provides some considerations that formed the basis\nof why feature-u was developed!\nI hope you enjoy this effort, and comments are always welcome.\n\nP.S. The feature-u library was pulled from a sandbox project\neatery-nod that I use to study several technologies and\nframeworks.  It is a react-native expo mobile\napp.\nP.P.S. If you are wondering what the \"-u\" stands for, it is merely a\nsuccinct suffix that distinguishes a number of my published\nutilities.\nAs promised, here is the list ...\n\nFeature Encapsulation:\nMost characteristics of a feature strive to be self-sufficient and\nindependent.  Where possible, they operate within their own\nisolated implementation.\nSolution: Various feature-u traits\n\nFeature Collaboration:\nEven though a feature's implementation is encapsulated, it still\nneeds to interact with it's surroundings.  There is a need for\ncollaboration between features.  This however should be accomplished\nthrough a well-defined feature-based public interface.\nSolution: Cross Feature Communication\n\nFeature Based UI Composition:\nComponent composition can easily cross feature boundaries.  There\nis a need to facilitate cross-feature content injection in a\nseamless (and potentially autonomous) way.\nSolution: UI Composition\n\nFeature Initialization:\nAny given feature should not have to rely on an external startup\nprocess to perform the initialization that it needs.  Rather, the\nfeature should be able to spawn initialization that it depends on.\nThis could be any number of things, such as:\n\ninitialize some service API\ninject a utility react component at the root of the App\ndispatch an action that kicks off some startup process\netc.\n\nSolution: Application Life Cycle Hook\n\nFeature Enablement:\nYou may have the need for selected features to be dynamically\nenabled or disabled.  As an example, certain features may only be\nenabled with a license upgrade, or other features may only be used for\ndiagnostic purposes.\nSolution: Feature Enablement\n\nResource Resolution during Code Expansion:\nThere are situations where resource access can be problematic. This\nis typically a timing issue, during in-line code expansion,\nwhere the resource is not fully defined YET.  This ultimately is\ndue to order dependencies across features.  \nHow can this problem be minimized?\nSolution: Managed Code Expansion\n\nFramework Integration:\nMost likely your application employs a number of different\nframeworks (ex: redux, redux-logic, etc.).\nAs a result, your features are typically going to rely on these\nsame frameworks.\nHow are the resources needed by these frameworks accumulated and\nconfigured across the many features of your app?\nSolution: Extendable aspects -and- Launching Your Application\n\nUI Component Promotion:\nFeatures that maintain their own UI components need a way to promote\nthem in the overall app's GUI.  How is this accomplished in an\nautonomous way?\nSolution: Feature Based Routes\n\nSingle Source of Truth:\nWhat are some Best Practices for \"Single Source of Truth\" as it\nrelates to features, and how can feature-u help?\nSolution: see: Best Practices\n\nSimplified App Startup:\nAfter breaking your application into pieces (i.e. features), how do\nyou pull it all together, and actually start your app running?\nAt first glance, this may seem like a daunting task.  As it\nturns out, however, because of the structure promoted by feature-u,\nit actually is a very simple process.\nSolution: Launching Your Application\n\n\n"},"history.html":{"url":"history.html","title":"Revision History","keywords":"","body":"Revision History\nThe feature-u project adheres to Semantic\nVersioning.

It represents a significant step\nforward in providing seamless feature-based development.\nSideBar: To give you some background, the V1 design progressed\nfrom a simple plugin to a full core offering:\n\nInitially, the focus was on a new navigation plugin that supported\nreact-router.\n\nWith react-router's V4 release, we realized our plugin could broaden\nit's scope to overall UI Composition - because that is how RR V4\nworks.\n\nAs a further progression, we realized that\nUI Composition was simply one part of the\noverall Cross Feature Communication.  By incorporating this into a core\nfeature-u offering, all cross-communication could use the same\nmechanism.\nIn addition, this seemed like a good time to to standardize some\nambiguous terms from our initial cross-communication attempt.\n\n\nfeature-u migration\n\nThe return of launchApp() is now the\nFassets object.  Per the recomendation to export this,\nplease note that this is no longer the app object, rather the\nFassets object.\n\nAny feature-u API that was passing the app object as a\nparameter, is NOW the Fassets object.\nDepending on your IDE and dev environment, this can be a tedious\nproces to retrofit.  If you are using some type of search, the\n\"app\" nominclature is going to appear in many different contexts.\n\nEither work through your code base, one by one (searching for app\nparameters/variables)\n\nOr focus on the various APIs summarized in the Core API\n(focusing on the signatures with fassets parameters).\nIf you are retrofitting an Aspect plugin, do the same thing with\nthe Extension API.\n\n\n\nAny Feature.publicFace aspect must be converted to the new\nFeature.fassets aspect.\nWhile it is possible to translate a one-to-one mapping (between the\nold publicFace and the new fassets aspect) you are encourged to\nemploy the new enhancments of Cross Feature Communication, such as:\n\nFull UI Composition via the\nwithFassets() HoC.\n\nResource Contracts, via the fassets.use\nand fassets.defineUse directives.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, refactor out the featureName\nresource qualifier.\n\n\nHere is an example that translates publicFace to fassets with\nan equivilant mapping:\n\n\n   OLD publicFace\n   publicFace: { // OBSOLETE in feature-u V1\n     api,\n     sel: {\n       areFontsLoaded,\n       isDeviceReady,\n       getDeviceLoc,\n     },\n     actions: {\n       ready: actions.ready,\n     },\n   },\n\n    \n   NEW fassets.define equivalent\n   fassets: { // NEW feature-u V1\n     define: {\n       [`${featureName}.api`]:                api,\n\n       [`${featureName}.sel.areFontsLoaded`]: areFontsLoaded,\n       [`${featureName}.sel.isDeviceReady`]:  isDeviceReady,\n       [`${featureName}.sel.getDeviceLoc`]:   getDeviceLoc,\n\n       [`${featureName}.actions.ready`]:      actions.ready,\n     },\n   },\n\nfeature-redux migration\nIf you are using the feature-redux plugin, you must\ninstall the latest version.\n\nThis plugin has eliminated singletons in favor of creators (to\nfacilitate testing and server-side rendering).\n // in place of this:\n import {reducerAspect}   from 'feature-redux';\n\n // do this:\n import {createReducerAspect} from 'feature-redux';\n const reducerAspect = createReducerAspect();\n\n\n\nfeature-redux-logic migration\nIf you are using the feature-redux-logic plugin, you must\ninstall the latest version.\n\nBecause feature-redux-logic auto injects the\nFassets object as a dependency in your logic modules\n(promoting full Cross Feature Communication, the logic modules in your\napplication code must reflect this change by renaming this named\nparameter from app to fassets, and utilize the new fassets API\naccordingly.\n\nThis plugin has eliminated singletons in favor of creators (to\nfacilitate testing and server-side rendering).\n // in place of this:\n import {logicAspect}   from 'feature-redux-logic';\n\n // do this:\n import {createLogicAspect} from 'feature-redux-logic';\n const logicAspect = createLogicAspect();\n\n\n\nfeature-router migration\nIf you are using the feature-router plugin, you must\ninstall the latest version.\n\nBecause feature-router auto injects the\nFassets object as a dependency in your routes (promoting\nfull Cross Feature Communication), the routes in your application code\nmust reflect this change by renaming this named parameter from app\nto fassets, and utilize the new fassets API accordingly.\n\nThis plugin has eliminated singletons in favor of creators (to\nfacilitate testing and server-side rendering).\n // in place of this:\n import {routeAspect}   from 'feature-router';\n\n // do this:\n import {createRouteAspect} from 'feature-router';\n const routeAspect = createRouteAspect();\n\n\n\n \n"},"LICENSE.html":{"url":"LICENSE.html","title":"MIT License","keywords":"","body":"MIT License\nCopyright (c) 2018 Kevin Bridges\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
